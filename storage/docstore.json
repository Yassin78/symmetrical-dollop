On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. \\n \\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor: \\n \\n* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. \\n* When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. \\n* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \\n \\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. \\n \\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \\n \\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \\n \\n### Unarmored Defense \\n \\nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. \\n \\n### Reckless Attack \\n \\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \\n \\n### Danger Sense \\n \\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \\n \\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \\n \\n### Primal Path \\n \\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \\n \\n### Ability Score Improvement \\n \\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \\n \\n### Extra Attack \\n \\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \\n \\n### Fast Movement \\n \\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. \\n \\n### Feral Instinct \\n \\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \\n \\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \\n \\n### Brutal Critical \\n \\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \\n \\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \\n \\n### Relentless Rage \\n \\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.

As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being. \\n \\n##### Frenzy \\n \\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A). \\n \\n##### Mindless Rage \\n \\nBeginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. \\n \\n##### Intimidating Presence \\n \\nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you.

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. \\n \\n#### Spell Slots \\n \\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.

Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \\n \\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \\n \\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \\n \\n#### Ritual Casting \\n \\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Focus \\n \\nYou can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. \\n \\n### Bardic Inspiration \\n \\nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. \\n \\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. \\n \\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. \\n \\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.

Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. \\n \\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. \\n \\nThe college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority. \\n \\n##### Bonus Proficiencies \\n \\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice. \\n \\n##### Cutting Words \\n \\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.

You can silence the most violent explosions, you can make whispers seem to reverberate forever, and you can even change the sounds of music and words as they are created.\\n\\n##### Echolocation\\nWhen you join the College of Echoes at 3rd level, you learn how to see with your ears as well as your eyes. As long as you can hear, you have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet, and you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deafen you.

The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal.\\n\\n##### Reverberating Strikes\\nAt 14th level, your Bardic Inspiration infuses your allies' weapon attacks with sonic power. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made, and all of the damage from that attack becomes thunder damage.

You have disadvantage on this check if the target is not a humanoid, and the check automatically fails against creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower.

When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you is damaged by a hostile creature's attack, it can use its reaction to roll that die and reduce the damage by twice the number rolled. If this reduces the damage of the attack to 0, the creature you inspired can make one melee attack against its attacker as part of the same reaction.\\n\\n##### Hot Pursuit\\nStarting at 14th level, when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your bard spells, you can designate it as your mark for 24 hours. You know the direction to your mark at all times unless it is within an antimagic field, it is protected by an effect that prevents scrying such as nondetection, or there is a barrier of lead at least 1 inch thick between you.\\n  In addition, whenever your mark makes an attack roll, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to subtract the number rolled from the mark's attack roll. Alternatively, whenever you make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect from your mark, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add the number rolled to your saving throw.

You can use an action to focus on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. You can use this feature as a bonus action if you expend a Bardic Inspiration die. If you do, roll the die and subtract the number rolled from the target's saving throw roll. If the target fails the saving throw, choose one of the following: \\n* You have advantage on your next attack roll against the target. \\n* You know the target's damage vulnerabilities. \\n* You know the target's damage resistances and damage immunities. \\n* You know the target's condition immunities. \\n* You see through any illusions obscuring or affecting the target for 1 minute.\\n\\n##### Shadowed Performance\\nStarting at 14th level, you are a master at weaving stories and influencing the minds of your audience. If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to make or break a creature's reputation by relaying a tale to an audience through song, poetry, play, or other medium. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids who witnessed the entire performance, up to a number equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a target suffers one of the following (your choice): \\n* For 24 hours, the target believes the tale you told is true and will tell others the tale as if it were truth. \\n* For 1 hour, the target believes *someone* nearby knows their darkest secret, and they have disadvantage on Charisma, Wisdom, and Intelligence ability checks and saving throws as they are distracted and overcome with paranoia. \\n* The target becomes convinced that you (or one of your allies if you choose to sing the praises of another) are a fearsome opponent. For 1 minute, the target is frightened of you (or your ally), and you (or your ally) have advantage on attack rolls against the target.

These minstrels gain a devoted following and rarely lack for company. Some of their devotees go so far as to put themselves at the service of the bard they admire. Though members of the college can be found as traveling minstrels and adventuring troubadours, they gravitate to large urban areas where their silver tongues and mind-bending performances have the greatest influence. Devious rulers sometimes seek out members of the college as counsellors, but the rulers must be wary lest they become a mere pawn of their new aide.\\n\\n##### Entourage\\nWhen you join the College of Sincerity at 3rd level, you gain the service of two commoners. Your entourage is considered charmed by you and travels with you to see to your mundane needs, such as making your meals and doing your laundry. If you are in an urban area, they act as your messengers and gofers. When you put on a performance, they speak your praises and rouse the crowd to applause. In exchange for their service, you must provide your entourage a place to live and pay the costs for them to share the same lifestyle as you.\\n  Your entourage doesn't join combat or venture into obviously dangerous areas or situations. If you or your companions abuse or mistreat your entourage, they leave your service immediately. If this occurs, you can gain the service of a new entourage by traveling to a different urban area where you must perform at least 1 hour each day for one week.\\n  You gain another commoner at 6th level, and a final one at 14th level. If you prefer, instead of gaining a new commoner at 6th level, one member of your entourage can become a guard. At 14th level, if you have a guard, it can become your choice of a spy or veteran, instead of taking on a new commoner. If one member of your entourage becomes a guard, spy, or veteran, that person accompanies you into dangerous situations, but they only use the Help action to aid you, unless you use a bonus action to direct them to take a specific action.

Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \\n \\n#### Domain Spells \\n \\nEach domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \\n \\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \\n \\n### Channel Divinity \\n \\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \\n \\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \\n \\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.

You don't provoke opportunity attacks while flying in this way.\\n\\n##### Stormshield\\nAt 6th level, when you take lightning or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage, including against the triggering attack, until the start of your next turn.

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. \\n \\n### Spellcasting \\n \\nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. \\n \\n#### Cantrips \\n \\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. \\n \\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \\n \\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \\n \\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \\n \\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \\n \\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \\n \\n### Spellcasting Ability \\n \\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \\n \\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \\n \\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \\n \\n### Ritual Casting \\n \\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Focus \\n \\nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. \\n \\n### Wild Shape \\n \\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \\n \\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \\n \\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. \\n \\n**Beast Shapes (table)** \\n \\n| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     | \\n|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------| \\n| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        | \\n| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   | \\n| 8th   | 1       | -                           | Giant eagle | \\n \\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. \\n \\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply: \\n \\n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. \\n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. \\n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. \\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. \\n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with", "doc_id": "bfa475e0-b10c-4fec-9ba0-8b52e6a561ef", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2ae29c2a29c9cbc4b83b89f87c955dfcfbc8332e0db6e1cfdbfb0f4a8dcf591b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 133651, "end": 137288}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "e514f1a9-d854-455e-aa3a-58a3b466ce64", "3": "113909cd-5de6-46de-84b7-eac8cec22e38"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "113909cd-5de6-46de-84b7-eac8cec22e38": {"__data__": {"text": "or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. \\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.

Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. \\n \\n### Druid Circle \\n \\nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \\n \\n### Ability Score Improvement \\n \\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \\n \\n### Timeless Body \\n \\nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. \\n \\n### Beast Spells \\n \\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. \\n \\n### Archdruid \\n \\nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. \\n \\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell.

During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level \\n(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. \\n \\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots. \\n \\n##### Circle Spells \\n \\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of spells. \\n \\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. \\n \\n**Arctic (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                     | \\n|-------------|-----------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | hold person, spike growth         | \\n| 5th         | sleet storm, slow                 | \\n| 7th         | freedom of movement, ice storm    | \\n| 9th         | commune with nature, cone of cold | \\n \\n**Coast (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                      | \\n|-------------|------------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | mirror image, misty step           | \\n| 5th         | water breathing, water walk        | \\n| 7th         | control water, freedom of movement | \\n| 9th         | conjure elemental, scrying         | \\n \\n**Desert (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                                 | \\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | blur, silence                                 | \\n| 5th", "doc_id": "ea87cbdd-320d-45b1-928b-06e0f9b15a1f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "72d568e19e6e04fa43c259335b33410dc3997e8c18dca769dcb33241fcccd91c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 145628, "end": 148558}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "fae8ba5b-7dee-42c8-8a76-e663c39c734e", "3": "dbb31a22-7584-4147-8e3a-a21ae680f2d6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbb31a22-7584-4147-8e3a-a21ae680f2d6": {"__data__": {"text": "        | water breathing, water walk        | \\n| 7th         | control water, freedom of movement | \\n| 9th         | conjure elemental, scrying         | \\n \\n**Desert (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                                 | \\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | blur, silence                                 | \\n| 5th         | create food and water, protection from energy | \\n| 7th         | blight, hallucinatory terrain                 | \\n| 9th         | insect plague, wall of stone                  | \\n \\n**Forest (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                    | \\n|-------------|----------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | barkskin, spider climb           | \\n| 5th         | call lightning, plant growth     | \\n| 7th         | divination, freedom of movement  | \\n| 9th         | commune with nature, tree stride | \\n \\n**Grassland (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                    | \\n|-------------|----------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | invisibility, pass without trace | \\n| 5th         | daylight, haste                  | \\n| 7th         | divination, freedom of movement  | \\n| 9th         | dream, insect plague             | \\n \\n**Mountain (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                   | \\n|-------------|---------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | spider climb, spike growth      | \\n| 5th         | lightning bolt, meld into stone | \\n| 7th         | stone shape, stoneskin          | \\n| 9th         | passwall, wall of stone         | \\n \\n**Swamp (table)** \\n \\n| Druid Level | Circle Spells                        | \\n|-------------|--------------------------------------| \\n| 3rd         | acid arrow, darkness                 | \\n| 5th         | water walk, stinking cloud           | \\n| 7th         | freedom of movement, locate creature | \\n| 9th         | insect plague, scrying               | \\n \\n##### Land's Stride \\n \\nStarting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \\n \\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \\n \\n##### Nature's Ward \\n \\nWhen you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. \\n \\n##### Nature's Sanctuary \\n \\nWhen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. \\n \\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. \\n \\n> ### Sacred Plants and Wood \\n> \\n> A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. \\n> \\n> Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. \\n> \\n> Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. \\n \\n> ### Druids and the Gods \\n> \\n> Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd'}, {'name': 'Circle of Ash', 'slug': 'circle-of-ash', 'desc': \"Druids of the Circle of Ash believe in the power of rebirth and resurrection, both physical and spiritual.

The ash they take as their namesake is the result of burning and death, but it can fertilize the soil and help bring forth new life. For these druids, ash is the ultimate symbol of the elegant cycle of life and death that is the foundation of the natural world. Some such druids even use fresh ash to clean themselves, and the residue is often kept visible on their faces.\\n  Druids of this circle often use the phoenix as their symbol, an elemental creature that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. These druids aspire to the same purity and believe resurrection is possible if they are faithful to their beliefs. Others of this circle are drawn to volcanos and find volcanic eruptions and their resulting ash clouds to be auspicious events.\\n  All Circle of Ash druids request to be cremated after death, and their ashes are often given over to others of their order. What later happens with these ashes, none outside the circle know.\\n\\n##### Ash Cloud\\nAt 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape and, rather than assuming a beast form, create a small, brief volcanic eruption beneath the ground, causing it to spew out an ash cloud. As an action, choose a point within 30 feet of you that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n  This eruption creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the eruption point. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until the start of its next turn. Creatures that don't need to breathe or that are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\\n  You automatically succeed on this saving throw while within the area of your ash cloud, but you don't automatically succeed if you are in another Circle of Ash druid's ash cloud.\\n  The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\\n\\n##### Firesight\\nStarting at 2nd level, your vision can't be obscured by ash, fire, smoke, fog, or the cloud created by your Ash Cloud feature, but it can still be obscured by other effects, such as dim light, dense foliage, or rain. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against gas or cloud-based effects, such as from the *cloudkill* or *stinking cloud* spells, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a kraken's ink cloud.\\n#### Covered in Ash\\nAt 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see (including yourself) takes damage, you can use your reaction to cover the creature in magical ash, giving it temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target gains the temporary hit points before it takes the damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\\n  In addition, while your Ash Cloud feature is active and you are within 30 feet of it, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the cloud.

You can use this teleportation no more than once per minute.\\n\\n##### Feed the Earth\\nAt 10th level, your Ash Cloud feature becomes more potent. Instead of the normal eruption effect, when you first create the ash cloud, each creature within 10 feet of the point you chose must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n  In addition, when a creature enters this more potent ash cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws while it remains within the cloud. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe, but creatures that are immune to poison are immune to this effect.\\n  If at least one creature takes damage from the ash cloud's eruption, you can use your reaction to siphon that destructive energy into the rapid growth of vegetation. The area within the cloud becomes difficult terrain that lasts while the cloud remains. You can't cause this growth in an area that can't accommodate natural plant growth, such as the deck of a ship or inside a building.\\n  The ash cloud now lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\\n\\n##### From the Ashes\\nBeginning at 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, your body is consumed in a fiery explosion. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon the Green spirit rather than assuming a beast form.\\n  The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. When the spirit appears, the area in a 10-foot radius around it becomes tangled with vines and other plant growth, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.\\n  The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Green Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.\\n  You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches and leaves, while others look like creatures with leafy bodies and heads made of gourds or fruit. Some even resemble beasts, only made entirely of plant material.\\n  In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The green spirit can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\\n  The spirit remains for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die. When it manifests, the spirit bears 10 fruit that are infused with magic. Each fruit works like a berry created by the *goodberry* spell.\\n\\n##### Gift of the Green\\nAt 6th level, the bond with your green spirit enhances your restorative spells and gives you the power to cast additional spells. Once before the spirit's duration ends, you can cast one of the following spells without expending a spell slot or material components: *locate animals or plants*, *pass without trace* (only in environments with ample plant life), *plant growth*, or *speak with plants*. You can't cast a spell this way again until the next time you summon your green spirit.\\n  Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points while your green spirit is summoned, roll a d8 and add the result to the total hit points restored.\\n  In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your green spirit.\\n\\n##### Verdant Interference\\nStarting at 10th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you or your green spirit is attacked, you can use your reaction to cause vines and vegetation to burst from the ground and grasp at the attacker, giving the attacker disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.\\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\\n\\n##### Spirit Symbiosis\\nAt 14th level, while your green spirit is within 30 feet of you, you can use an action to join with it, letting its plant matter grow around you.

Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. \\n \\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind.

You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. \\n \\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects.

Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: \\n* It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. \\n* It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. \\n* It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. \\n \\n##### Wholeness of Body \\n \\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. \\n \\n##### Tranquility \\n \\nBeginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. \\n \\n##### Quivering Palm \\n \\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. \\n \\nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time.

While you are flying, a creature that hits you with an opportunity attack takes 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.\\n\\n##### Conquering Wyrm\\nBeginning at 11th level, when you take the Attack action after using Step of the Wind in the same turn, you can spend an extra 2 ki points to replace your first attack with one unarmed strike against each creature within 5 feet of the space in which you end your movement. On a hit, your unarmed strike deals an extra 4d6 of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation. You can't use this feature and your Draconic Onslaught feature in the same round.\\n\\n##### Scales of the Wyrm\\nAt 17th level, you can harden yourself against harm like the eldest of dragons. On your turn, you can spend 4 ki points to increase your Armor Class by 2, gain temporary hit points equal to your monk level, and gain immunity to the frightened condition for 10 minutes.

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \\n \\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \\n \\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \\n \\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Ability \\n \\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \\n \\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \\n \\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Focus \\n \\nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. \\n \\n### Divine Smite \\n \\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. \\n \\n### Divine Health \\n \\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\\n\\n ### Sacred Oath \\n\\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. \\n \\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. \\n \\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. \\n \\n#### Oath Spells \\n \\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \\n \\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. \\n \\n#### Channel Divinity \\n \\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. \\n \\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \\n \\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\\n\\n>### Breaking Your Oath \\n>\\n> A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. \\n> \\n> A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. \\n> \\n> If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.\\n \\n### Ability Score Improvement \\n \\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \\n \\n### Extra Attack \\n \\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \\n \\n### Aura of Protection \\n \\nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. \\n \\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \\n \\n### Aura of Courage \\n \\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious. \\n \\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \\n \\n### Improved Divine Smite \\n \\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath.

On a failure, it is tethered and can't move more than 30 feet away from you for 1 minute. While tethered, the target takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) at the end of each of its turns. You can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by the tethered creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the creature's choice). On a success, you can pull the creature up to 15 feet in a straight line toward you. As an action, the tethered creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks the tether.\\n\\n***Justicar's Celerity.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to respond to danger with lightning speed. When a creature that you can see is attacked, you can move up to your speed as a reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you can make one melee attack against it as part of this reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the target of the attack, you can become the target of the attack instead as part of this reaction.\\n\\n##### Disciplined Pursuant\\nAt 7th level, you can bend the laws of magic to parallel the laws of civilization. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell or Divine Smite, you can choose to knock out the creature instead of killing it. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\\n  In addition, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one creature to be affected by this feature.\\n\\n##### Shackles of Light\\nStarting at 15th level, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is restrained by golden, spectral chains until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one such creature to be affected by this feature. The target of this feature can be different from the target of your Disciplined Pursuant feature.\\n\\n##### Avatar of Perfect Order\\nAt 20th level, you can take on the appearance of justice itself. As an action, you become wreathed in a garment of cold light. For 1 minute, you benefit from the following effects: \\n* You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \\n* You can use your Justicar's Celerity feature without expending a use of Channel Divinity. \\n* When a creature you can see takes the Attack or Cast a Spell action, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must take a different action of your choice instead.\\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\", 'document__slug': 'toh', 'document__title': 'Tome of Heroes OGL', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/'}, {'name': 'Oath of Safeguarding', 'slug': 'oath-of-safeguarding', 'desc': \"Paladins who choose the Oath of Safeguarding spend their lives in service to others, conserving the people and places they vow to protect.

They take missions to guard against assassination attempts, safely transport a person or group through treacherous lands, and stand as bastions for locations under attack. These paladins are no mere mercenaries, however, as they view their missions as sacred vows.\\n\\n##### Tenets of Safeguarding\\nPaladins undertaking the Oath of Safeguarding take their responsibilities seriously and are most likely to seek atonement should they fail in their duties. However, they have no qualms about terminating their protection when their charges prove nefarious. In these cases, they won't leave people stranded in a hostile environment or situation, but they also focus their efforts on their allies over unworthy, former charges. Even when these paladins serve no charge, they seek opportunities to shield others from harm. In combat, they rush to aid their allies and stand alone to allow others to flee from battle.\\n\\n***Last Line of Defense.*** When your allies must retreat or regroup, you remain to ensure they have ample time to withdraw before withdrawing yourself. If your mission requires you to guard a building, you are the final obstacle the attackers face before breaching the building.\\n\\n***Protect the Charge.*** You pledge to preserve the lives of people you protect and the sanctity of all structures you guard, even if it means endangering yourself. When you must rest, you ensure your charge is as safe as possible, turning to trusted allies to aid you.\\n\\n***Shield All Innocents.*** In the absence of a sacred charge to protect, you endeavor to keep all those who can't defend themselves safe from harm. In cases where your charge must take priority, you do what you can to defend the helpless.\\n\\n***Uphold the Vow.*** You acknowledge the person you protect may reveal themselves as unworthy, such as by committing nefarious acts or exploiting your protection and fidelity, or the location you guard may become a site of terrible acts. When you witness this, you are free to terminate your guardianship. However, you don't leave your now-former charge in any present danger, if only for the possibility of future atonement.\\n\\n ***Unwavering.*** Nothing shall distract you from your mission. If you are magically compelled to desert your post, you do your utmost to resume your duty. Failing that, you take out your vengeance on the party responsible for your dereliction.\\n\\n##### Oath Spells\\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Safeguarding Spells table.

See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\\n\\n***Insurmountable Passage.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and stamp one foot on the ground. The ground within 60 feet of you magically becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. When you use this feature, you can designate up to 10 creatures that can ignore the difficult terrain.\\n\\n***Protect from Harm.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak reassuring words. For 1 minute, each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you has advantage on saving throws against spells and abilities that deal damage. In addition, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.\\n\\n##### Aura of Preservation\\nBeginning at 7th level, you emit an aura of safety while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction. The first time you or a friendly creature within the aura would take damage from a weapon attack between the end of your previous turn and the start of your next turn, the target of the attack has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, each friendly creature within the aura has advantage on death saving throws.\\n  When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet, and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\\n\\n##### Battlefield Controller\\nStarting at 15th level, you can't be shoved. When a hostile creature within 10 feet of you moves more than 10 feet away from you, you can use your reaction to move up to 10 feet and make an attack against that creature.\\n\\n##### Redoubtable Defender\\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can touch your charge, typically a creature or structure, and create a magical link between you, which appears as a razor-thin, ghostly silver tether. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits: \\n* You know the general status and well-being of your charge, such as if your charge is wounded or experiencing a particularly strong emotion, or, in the case of an object or structure, if it is damaged. \\n* As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your charge, if it is a person or object. If the charge is a structure, you can choose to teleport to any unoccupied space within the structure. \\n* You are immune to spells and effects that cause you to be charmed or might otherwise influence you to harm your charge. \\n* If your charge is a creature and within 5 feet of you, the charge is immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it has advantage on all saving throws. \\n* You can use an action to erect a barrier for 1 minute, similar to a *wall of force*, to protect your charge.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and recite ancient edicts from when the elements ruled the world. Each elemental or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\\n\\n##### Elemental Strike.\\nAs a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to magically imbue one weapon you are holding with the power of the elements. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. For 1 minute, you gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) on attacks made with the weapon. The type of damage is based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type instead of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite.\\n  You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\\n\\n##### Aura of Resistance\\nBeginning at 7th level, your power over the elements forms a magical ward around you. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage when you finish a short or long rest. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage of this type. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\\n\\n##### Elemental Companion\\nAt 15th level, you can call upon the service of an elemental companion to aid you on your quests. As an action, you can summon an elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any verbal commands you issue to it.

If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\\n\\n##### Aura of Awareness\\nStarting at 7th level, allies around you are more alert and ready to act. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 10 feet of you can't be surprised except when incapacitated.

You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \\n \\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \\n \\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \\n \\n### Ranger Archetype \\n \\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description.

This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. \\n \\n### Ability Score Improvement \\n \\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \\n \\n### Extra Attack \\n \\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \\n \\n### Land's Stride \\n \\nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \\n \\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \\n \\n### Hide in Plain Sight \\n \\nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. \\n \\nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. \\n \\n### Vanish \\n \\nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. \\n \\n### Feral Senses \\n \\nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. \\n \\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. \\n \\n### Foe Slayer \\n \\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.\", 'hit_dice': '1d10', 'hp_at_1st_level': '10 + your Constitution modifier', 'hp_at_higher_levels': '1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st', 'prof_armor': 'Light armor, medium armor, shields', 'prof_weapons': 'Simple weapons, martial weapons', 'prof_tools': 'None', 'prof_saving_throws': 'Strength, Dexterity',", "doc_id": "1ffe8c04-9f9d-4ca3-b5ec-92f6fb3f4eb2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1e323c81288d4b3c2b968dcf42d28dd7b982b8f7ac4ca91c22d38dad55e194f2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 350563, "end": 354283}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "b07e6a66-d91a-48ec-84bd-722a483dbfe1", "3": "1f68a054-a3b4-468f-8f37-694c90936f13"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f68a054-a3b4-468f-8f37-694c90936f13": {"__data__": {"text": "Foe Slayer \\n \\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.

Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. \\n \\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. \\n \\n### Cunning Action \\n \\nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. \\n \\n### Roguish Archetype \\n \\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description.

As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \\n \\n### Uncanny Dodge \\n \\nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you. \\n \\n### Evasion \\n \\nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \\n \\n### Reliable Talent \\n \\nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. \\n \\n### Blindsense \\n \\nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. \\n \\n### Slippery Mind \\n \\nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. \\n \\n### Elusive \\n \\nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated. \\n \\n### Stroke of Luck \\n \\nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. \\n \\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \\n \\n### Roguish Archetypes \\n \\nRogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes.

You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items. \\n \\n##### Thief's Reflexes \\n \\nWhen you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger.

Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls. In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find; after all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there? Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or warded by magic.\\n\\nSome cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums. You'll likely end up someplace you're not supposed to be, but those are the places most worth visiting!\\n\\n##### Up, Over, and In\\nBeginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed equal to or greater than your walking speed, it increases by 5 feet. In addition, when you are falling, you can use your reaction to soften the fall. You reduce the falling damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus + your rogue level. You don't land prone, unless the damage you take from the fall would reduce you to less than half your hit point maximum.\\n\\n##### Artful Dodger\\nAt 3rd level, alert to the dangers posed by hidden traps and wards, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist a trap or a magic effect with a trigger, such as the *glyph of warding* spell, and you have resistance to the damage dealt by such effects.\\n\\n##### Cat's Eye\\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to find or disarm traps, locate secret or hidden doors, discern the existence of an illusion, or spot a *glyph of warding*. You can also search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only while at a slow pace.\\n\\n##### Breaking and Entering\\nAt 13th level, when you make an attack against a door, gate, window, shutters, bars, or similar object or structure that is blocking or barring an egress, you have advantage on the attack roll, and you can add your Sneak Attack damage on a hit. You can choose for this damage to be audible out to a range of 100 feet or to be audible only within 5 feet of the point where you hit the object or structure. Similarly, you can choose for this damage to appear more or less impactful than it actually is, such as neatly carving a hole for you to squeeze through a wall or window or bursting a door off its hinges.\\n\\nYour expertise at deftly dismantling crafted works extends to constructs and undead.

You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.\\n\\n**Soulspy Spellcasting**\\n| Rouge Level  | Cantrips Known | Spells Unknown | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | \\n|--------------|----------------|----------------------|-----|-----|-----| \\n| 3rd          | 3              | 3              | 2   | -   | -   | -   | \\n| 4th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \\n| 5th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \\n| 6th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \\n| 7th          | 3              | 5              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \\n| 8th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \\n| 9th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \\n| 10th         | 4              | 7              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \\n| 11th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \\n| 12th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \\n| 13th         | 4              | 9              | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \\n| 14th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \\n| 15th         | 4              | 10 ", "doc_id": "e48a3b75-cca9-41ec-8488-96653d520149", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fb1d508de96193ab88dc303b5b5e918d460c705f7a5afb0b3b4eded1bfaa405a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 429460, "end": 431372}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "7af15595-c2a9-460b-8288-0af1cc1f0c25", "3": "a240054f-46d0-43d9-a7ba-a211878eb07a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a240054f-46d0-43d9-a7ba-a211878eb07a": {"__data__": {"text": "   | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \\n| 13th         | 4              | 9              | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \\n| 14th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \\n| 15th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \\n| 16th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \\n| 17th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \\n| 18th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \\n| 19th         | 4              | 12             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   | \\n| 20th         | 4              | 13             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   |\\n\\n##### Spell Slots\\nThe Soulspy Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher.

The Spells Known column of the Soulspy Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher.

The symbol is a Tiny object that is visible but invulnerable and intangible, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While this symbol is active, you gain the following benefits: \\n* Your Divine Symbol functions as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \\n* As a bonus action, you can turn the symbol into thieves- tools, which you can use to pick locks, disarm traps, or any other activities that would normally require such tools. While your Divine Symbol is functioning in this way, it loses all other properties listed here. You can change it from thieves- tools back to its symbol form as a bonus action. \\n* The symbol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. When you extinguish the symbol-s light, you can also snuff out one candle, torch, or other nonmagical light source within 10 feet of you. \\n* When you create this symbol, and as an action on each of your turns while the symbol is active, you can force the symbol to shoot divine energy at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you reach certain levels in this class, the symbol-s damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\\n\\n##### Sacred Stealth\\nStarting at 9th level, you can use your Sneak Attack on a creature hit by an attack with your Divine Symbol if the target of the attack is within 5 feet of an ally, that ally isn-t incapacitated, and you don-t have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\\n\\n##### Touching the Soul\\nWhen you reach 13th level, you can use your Divine Symbol to deliver your cleric spells that have a range of touch. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you as the target of the spell. You can-t use your Sacred Stealth feature on a spell delivered in this way. After you cast the spell, your Divine Symbol ends.\\n  In addition, when you cast a spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you can switch it to do the other type of damage instead.\\n\\n##### Life Thief\\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to magically channel life force energy out of one creature and into another. When you deal radiant or necrotic damage with your Divine Symbol attack or a cleric spell or cantrip, choose a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to half the radiant or necrotic damage dealt. You can target yourself with this feature.

This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. \\n \\n#### Cantrips \\n \\nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table. \\n \\n#### Spell Slots \\n \\nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \\n \\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *burning hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *burning hands* using either slot. \\n \\n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \\n \\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. \\n \\nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \\n \\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Ability \\n \\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \\n \\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \\n \\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Focus \\n \\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. \\n \\n### Sorcerous Origin \\n \\nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description. \\n \\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. \\n \\n### Font of Magic \\n \\nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself.

You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. \\n \\n**_Creating Spell Slots._** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn.

You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. \\n \\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. \\n \\n#### Careful Spell \\n \\nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. \\n \\n#### Distant Spell \\n \\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. \\n \\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. \\n \\n#### Empowered Spell \\n \\nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).

Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. \\n \\n##### Dragon Ancestor \\n \\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. \\n \\n**Draconic Ancestry (table)** \\n \\n| Dragon | Damage Type | \\n|--------|-------------| \\n| Black  | Acid        | \\n| Blue   | Lightning   | \\n| Brass  | Fire        | \\n| Bronze | Lightning   | \\n| Copper | Acid        | \\n| Gold   | Fire        | \\n| Green  | Poison      | \\n| Red    | Fire        | \\n| Silver | Cold        | \\n| White  | Cold        | \\n \\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic.

At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. \\n \\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. \\n \\n##### Elemental Affinity \\n \\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. \\n \\n##### Dragon Wings \\n \\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn.

As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends.

They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. \\n \\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\\n\\n\\n \\n> ### Your Pact Boon \\n> \\n> Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature. \\n> \\n> **_Pact of the Chain._** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it. \\n> \\n> **_Pact of the Blade._** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye. \\n> \\n> **_Pact of the Tome._** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast. \\n \\n### Ability Score Improvement \\n \\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \\n \\n### Mystic Arcanum \\n \\nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. \\n \\nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \\n \\nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest. \\n \\n### Eldritch Master \\n \\nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \\n \\n### Eldritch Invocations \\n \\nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. \\n", "doc_id": "a6aa7417-437b-4472-9b93-567eedaa7489", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c7aa3f249bb5da69a57fbcc285215cf15b9d8c803448c8310fbe1c720b364123", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 504745, "end": 508409}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "e3409c0f-36ef-47af-b79e-9b91d890a431", "3": "3d83a04c-62c4-4f6f-a628-afb4b9a26b7a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d83a04c-62c4-4f6f-a628-afb4b9a26b7a": {"__data__": {"text": "and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.

You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. \\n \\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. \\n \\n#### Chains of Carceri \\n \\n*Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature* \\n \\nYou can cast *hold monster* at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components.

Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.

This feature can restore you to no more than half of your hit point maximum.\\n\\n***Draconic Sight.*** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this blessing increases its range by 30 feet. In addition, you can use an action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet of you in a location you can see or in an obvious location within range, such as behind a door or around a corner, for 1 minute. The sensor is an extension of your own senses, allowing you to see and hear through it as if you were in its place, but you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses while using this sensor. As a bonus action, you can move the sensor anywhere within 30 feet of you. The sensor can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, and if it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can use an action to end the sensor early.\\n  A creature that can see the sensor, such as a creature benefiting from *see invisibility* or truesight, sees a luminous, intangible dragon's eye about the size of your fist.\\n\\n***Elemental Versatility.*** Choose one of the following when you accept this blessing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

When you finish a long rest, you choose which ascended blessing to accept. While you have an ascended blessing, you receive the benefits of its associated wyrmling blessing in addition to any new features of the ascended blessing. You can have only one blessing active at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.\\n\\n***Aquatic Command.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Aquatic Affinity wyrmling blessing. You can cast the *control water* and *dominate beast* spells without expending spell slots. When you cast the *dominate beast* spell, you can target only beasts that can breathe water. You can cast each spell once in this way and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.\\n\\n***Crystallized Hunger.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Hunger wyrmling blessing. When you kill a creature, you can crystallize a portion of its essence to create an essence gem. This gem functions as an *ioun stone of protection*, but it works only for you and has no value. As a bonus action, you can destroy the gem to regain one expended spell slot. You can have only one essence gem at a time. If you create a new essence gem while you already have an essence gem, the previous gem crumbles to dust and is destroyed. Once you create an essence gem, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\\n\\n***Draconic Senses.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Sight wyrmling blessing. You have blindsight out to a range of 15 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.\\n\\n***Elemental Expertise.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Elemental Versatility wyrmling blessing. When you cast a spell that deals damage of the chosen type, including a spell you changed using Elemental Versatility, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to deal damage of the chosen type equal to your proficiency bonus to the attacker. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\\n\\n##### Draconic Manifestation\\nAt 14th level, you can assume the form of a dragon.

Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in the fey courts and the Upper Planes. These timeless entities are connected to every animal of the kind they represent, and their primary concerns are for the well-being of these animals and the natural world as a whole.\\n  Your patron is one such animal lord. Animal lords are varied in their motivations and often come into conflict with each other. They each command legions of animal followers and gather information from all of them. Unlike many other patrons, animal lords often have close relationships with those they bind with pacts, some to control, others to guide and advise. You are your animal lord's hand in the affairs of humanoids, and your allies are as numerous as the spiders in the corner or the birds in the sky.\\n  You choose a specific animal lord to be your patron using the Animal Lord table. Each type of animal in the world can potentially have an animal lord. If you want to follow a specific type of animal lord, work with your GM to determine the animal lord's affinity and beast type and where that animal lord fits in the world. For a deeper dive on specific animal lords and for their game statistics, see *Creature Codex* and *Tome of Beasts 2*. These books aren't required to choose an animal lord as your patron or to play this class option.\\n\\n**Animal Lords (table)**\\n| Animal Lord        | Affinity | Beast Type              | \\n|--------------------|----------|-------------------------| \\n| Bat King           | Air      | Bats                    | \\n| Brother Ox         | Earth    | Hooved mammals          | \\n| Lord of Vultures   | Air      | Vultures, birds of prey | \\n| Mouse King         | Earth    | Rodents                 | \\n| Queen of Birds     | Air ", "doc_id": "ed596664-1a34-4be8-89a9-bc511a515419", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c49af685877289f3c9d103dfa8dcf1bfad995225454b3847c58af75fe4314ba0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 534053, "end": 537660}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "15da25bf-9db4-4340-886f-492fa5e1c252", "3": "a5934c84-4384-47e9-949a-6ce4dd9b0b58"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5934c84-4384-47e9-949a-6ce4dd9b0b58": {"__data__": {"text": "Animal Lord        | Affinity | Beast Type              | \\n|--------------------|----------|-------------------------| \\n| Bat King           | Air      | Bats                    | \\n| Brother Ox         | Earth    | Hooved mammals          | \\n| Lord of Vultures   | Air      | Vultures, birds of prey | \\n| Mouse King         | Earth    | Rodents                 | \\n| Queen of Birds     | Air      | Birds                   | \\n| Queen of Cats      | Earth    | Felines                 | \\n| Queen of Serpents  | Earth    | Reptiles                | \\n| Queen of Scorpions | Earth    | Arachnids               | \\n| Toad King          | Water    | Amphibians              |\\n\\n##### Expanded Spell List\\nAnimal Lords let you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

The companion acts as the animal lord's eyes and ears, allowing your patron to watch over you, and, at times, advise, warn, or otherwise communicate with you.\\n  Choose a beast that relates to your patron (as shown in the Beast Type column in the Animal Lords table) that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. If you have the Pact of the Chain Pact Boon, this beast becomes your familiar.\\n  Your patron companion is friendly to you and your companions, and you can speak with it as if you shared a language. It obeys your commands and, in combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. Your patron companion can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\\n  If your companion dies, your patron sends a new one to you after 24 hours. If your patron companions die too often, your patron might be reluctant to send a new one or might reprimand you in other ways.\\n\\n##### Primal Mastery\\nAt 10th level, you can use your bond to your patron to tap into the innate connection between all animals. At the end of each short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. \\n* **Cat Eyes.** You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet. \\n* **Chameleonic.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. \\n* **Fangs.** You grow fangs. The fangs are a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your fangs, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and your fangs deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. \\n* **Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for 10 minutes. \\n* **Keen Senses.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. \\n* **Leap.** Your jump distance is doubled. \\n* **Spry.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. \\n* **Swift.** Your speed increases by 10 feet. \\n* **Thick Hide.** You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. \\n* **Webbed Limbs.** You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.\\n\\n##### Call the", "doc_id": "f04401c1-d0cb-4034-bfac-49b680668f1d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7584a4f15b7b8971b8a1fb41d88cf91d44a90933ad095b1031120bc1c3b448b8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 540290, "end": 543972}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "a5934c84-4384-47e9-949a-6ce4dd9b0b58", "3": "8602af2c-0f0d-4d91-8d4b-f8e6a3362fdc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8602af2c-0f0d-4d91-8d4b-f8e6a3362fdc": {"__data__": {"text": "use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and your fangs deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. \\n* **Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for 10 minutes. \\n* **Keen Senses.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. \\n* **Leap.** Your jump distance is doubled. \\n* **Spry.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. \\n* **Swift.** Your speed increases by 10 feet. \\n* **Thick Hide.** You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. \\n* **Webbed Limbs.** You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.\\n\\n##### Call the Legions\\nAt 14th level, you can summon a horde of beasts to come to your aid. As an action, you call upon your animal lord, and several beasts of your patron's type appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you.

It cares not what you do with the power it grants you beyond that. Your connection with the Hunter can sometimes cause changes in your worldview.

If you consult your tome for 1 minute while inspecting tracks, you can identify the type of creature that left the tracks (such as a winter wolf), though not the creature's name or specific appearance (such as Frosttooth, the one-eyed leader of a notorious pack of winter wolves that terrorizes the area).\\n\\n##### Step Into Shadow\\nBeginning at 6th level, you can disappear into darkness and reappear next to an enemy.

You are proficient with the claws, and the claws count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You add your Charisma modifier to your attack and damage rolls with the claws. The damage is slashing and the damage die is a d6. If you have the Pact of the Blade feature, your claw attack benefits from your invocations as if it was a pact weapon. \\n* Your Sap Magic feature changes to Arcasynthesis: When a spell of 5th level or lower is cast within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic.

While you can't grasp the full measure of your patron's designs, as long as your bond is strong, there is nothing that can stand in your way.\\n\\n##### Expanded Spell List\\nThe Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\\n\\n**Primordial Expanded Spells (table)**\\n| Spell Level   | Spells                           | \\n|---------------|----------------------------------| \\n| 1st           | *command*, *healing word*        | \\n| 2nd           | *lesser restoration*, *mud*      | \\n| 3rd           | *power word fling*, *revivify*   | \\n| 4th           | *power word rend*, *stone shape* | \\n| 5th           | *conjure elemental*, *creation*  |\\n\\n##### Convulsion of the Worldbuilder\\nAt 1st level, you can use an action to call upon the bond between your primordial patron and the world it created to ripple shockwaves through the ground. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you, then choose if the ripples happen in a 30-foot cone, a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, or a 20-foot-radius burst. The ripples originate from or are centered on the point you chose, depending on the form the ripples take. Each creature in the cone, line, or burst must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\\n\\n##### Redirection\\nAt 6th level, you learn to channel the reality-bending powers of your patron to avoid attacks. When a creature you can see attacks only you, you can use your reaction to redirect the attack to a target of your choice within range of the attacker's weapon or spell. If no other target is within range, you can't redirect the attack.\\n  If the attack is from a spell of 4th level or higher, you must succeed on an ability check using your spellcasting ability to redirect it. The DC equals 12 + the spell's level.\\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\\n\\n##### Adaptive Shroud\\nAt 10th level, your bond with your patron protects you by adapting itself when you are injured. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 force damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a paralyzed target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the condition ends on the target.\\n\\n***Multiple Creatures.*** Each creature in a 20-footradius sphere centered on a point you can see within 100 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw.

You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel your patron abilities. The number of probability dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.\\n  You can use these dice to turn the odds in your or your ally's favor. When you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend probability dice from the pool, rolling the dice and adding the total result to that roll. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.\\n  When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your probability dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).\\n\\n##### Appropriate Advantage\\nAt 1st level, you learn to shift the weaves of fate to aid allies and hinder foes. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to expend one probability die and force that creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, adding the probability die to the DC. On a failed save, the creature loses advantage on that roll, and one friendly creature you can see within 60 feet has advantage on its next d20 roll of the same type the creature used (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw).\\n\\n##### Improbable Duplicate\\nAt 6th level, you can channel dark power from your patron to empower your attacks and spells. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one or more probability dice, up to half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and add the probability dice to the attack's damage roll.\\n\\n##### Inconceivable Channeling\\nAt 10th level, you learn to redirect magical energy, converting the power to restore your pool of probability dice. When a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to take the damage instead. You halve the damage you take as your probability wellspring absorbs some of the magical energy. For every 10 damage prevented in this way, you regain one expended probability die. You can't regain more than half your maximum probability dice from this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\\n\\n##### Favored Soul\\nStarting at 14th level, your very presence spins probability. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. \\n \\n#### Spellbook \\n \\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\\n \\n> ### Your Spellbook \\n> \\n> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. \\n> \\n> **_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. \\n> \\n> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it.

For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. \\n> \\n> **_The Book's Appearance._** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\\n \\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \\n \\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \\n \\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \\n \\nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \\n \\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Ability \\n \\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \\n \\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \\n \\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \\n \\n#### Ritual Casting \\n \\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. \\n \\n#### Spellcasting Focus \\n \\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. \\n \\n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher \\n \\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the \u201cYour Spellbook\u201d sidebar).\\n \\n### Arcane", "doc_id": "0144c142-3688-4292-bb67-bf1b9025fd0f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7358750304f86056e5814345d787a9120d5590f6dc7562879e1f6cdf9d8a29a9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 572062, "end": 575969}, "relationships": {"1": "43ec7f0b-47c8-4d1b-affb-6ca7dd333fa9", "2": "e263be18-c25e-40fe-8214-fed7b6f8a9c3", "3": "8e0c7757-c294-4a42-95f5-74cfa1e13784"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e0c7757-c294-4a42-95f5-74cfa1e13784": {"__data__": {"text": "+ your Intelligence modifier \\n \\n#### Ritual Casting \\n \\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.

Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. \\n \\nFor example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. \\n \\n### Arcane Tradition \\n \\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. \\n \\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \\n \\n### Ability Score Improvement \\n \\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \\n \\n### Spell Mastery \\n \\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \\n \\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. \\n \\n### Signature Spells \\n \\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. \\n \\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \\n \\n### Arcane Traditions \\n \\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. \\n \\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\\n  In addition, when you cast the *find familiar* spell, you can choose for your familiar to take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1/4 or lower, such as a flying snake, giant moth (see *Creature Codex*), or giant armadillo (see *Tome of Beasts 2*). The familiar has the statistics of the chosen beast form, but it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\\n  When you reach 6th level in this class, your familiar can take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1 or lower. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, your familiar can be any Tiny celestial, dragon, fey, or fiend that is CR 1 or lower.\\n\\n##### Greater Familiar\\nAlso at 2nd level, when you cast *find familiar*, your familiar gains the following additional benefits: \\n* Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, and it uses your proficiency bonus in place of its own when making ability checks and saving throws. It is proficient in any saving throw in which you are proficient. \\n* Your familiar's hit points equal its normal hit point maximum or 1 + your Intelligence modifier + three times your wizard level, whichever is higher. It has a number of Hit Dice (d4s) equal to your wizard level. \\n* In combat, your familiar shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take any action in its stat block or some other action.

It can understand and speak Common and either Celestial (if celestial), Sylvan (if fey), or Abyssal or Infernal (if fiend).\\n\\n##### Strengthened Bond\\nStarting at 6th level, your magical bond with your familiar grows stronger. If your familiar has a trait or action that forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. In addition, you can access your familiar's senses by using either an action or a bonus action, and whenever your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can expend its reaction to deliver any wizard spell you cast.

In addition, your familiar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\\n\\n##### Companion Concentration\\nStarting at 14th level, when you are concentrating on a spell of 3rd level or lower, you can use an action to draw on your connection with your familiar to pass the burden of concentration onto it, freeing you up to concentrate on a different spell.

The *heart to heart* (2nd), *dead walking* (3rd), *gird the spirit* (3rd), *life from death* (5th), and *lay to rest* (9th) spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook at the indicated wizard levels (see the Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells). Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\\n  Also at 2nd level, you can use your action and expend one wizard spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether undead are present within 1 mile of you. You know the general direction of the undead creatures, though not their exact locations or numbers, and you know the direction of the most powerful undead within range.\\n\\n##### Ward Against the Risen\\nStarting at 6th level, when an undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you targets an ally with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to hamper the attack or spell.

Undead creatures you kill using this feature are destroyed in a puff of golden motes.\\n\\n##### Radiant Nimbus\\nAt 14th level, you can use your action to envelope yourself in a shroud of golden flames for 1 minute. While enveloped, you gain the following benefits: \\n* When you summon the flames and as an action on each of your turns while the flames are active, you can frighten undead within 30 feet of you. Each undead creature in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the flames fade or until it takes damage. An undead creature with sunlight sensitivity (or hypersensitivity, in the case of vampires) also takes 4d6 radiant damage if it fails the saving throw. \\n* You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

A liminal space can be neither here nor there, and yet be both *here and there* at the same time. Stories of liminal spaces are common across cultures, though their true nature often isn't recognized by the uninitiated: the stranger who appears suddenly at a lonely crossroads, the troll that snatches at unwary travelers from a hiding spot beneath a bridge where no such hiding spot exists, the strangely familiar yet unsettlingly different scene that's sometimes glimpsed in a looking glass.\\n  These are only the most obvious encounters with liminal spaces! Most liminalities are more easily overlooked, being as unconscious as the heartbeat between waking and sleeping, as fleeting as drawing in breath as an apprentice and exhaling it as a master, or as unassumingly familiar\u2014and as fraught with potential\u2014as a doorway that's crossed a hundred times without incident.\\n  Those who specialize in liminal magic are known as liminists. They've learned to tap into the mysticism at the heart of spaces between spaces and to bend the possibilities inherent in transitional moments to their own ends.

Similarly, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits with an attack but hasn't yet rolled damage, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll the attack and use the lower result.

On a failed save, the creature suffers the effect or condition you just ended on yourself until the end of its next turn. For example, if you succeed on the saving throw to end the paralyzed condition on yourself from the hold person spell cast by a spellcaster you can see, you can force that spellcaster to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, and that spellcaster becomes paralyzed until the end of its next turn on a failed save.\\n\\n##### Spell Duality\\nAt 14th level, you become a master at manipulating and extending the magical energy of your longlasting spells.

For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\\n\\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\\n\\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd'}, {'slug': 'frightened', 'name': 'Frightened', 'desc': \"* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the", "doc_id": "cf102dff-ada0-4bf0-aaf1-6376252de135", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "33008b12dc8335750b3d33e1633c34448ba4f6e6e876ff1fd9718d2f7166c834", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3065}, "relationships": {"1": "c0e6130e-a9b6-4bd8-953f-aaadb37e3cf7", "3": "2ce1fb7c-a91b-4f99-988d-4dd64cfec1e0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ce1fb7c-a91b-4f99-988d-4dd64cfec1e0": {"__data__": {"text": "level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\\n\\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\\n\\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd'}, {'slug': 'frightened', 'name': 'Frightened', 'desc': \"* A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\\n* The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd'}, {'slug': 'grappled', 'name': 'Grappled', 'desc': \"* A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.\\n* The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).\\n* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *thunder-wave* spell.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd'}, {'slug': 'incapacitated', 'name': 'Incapacitated', 'desc': \"* An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd'}, {'slug': 'invisible', 'name': 'Invisible', 'desc': \"* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense.

You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature&#x27;s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\\nTo determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.\\nWhen that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don&#x27;t roll more than one additional d20.\\nIf two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling&#x27;s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\\nProficiency Bonus\\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\\nYour proficiency bonus can&#x27;t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it.

For example, the rogue&#x27;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn&#x27;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don&#x27;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\\nIn general, you don&#x27;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\\nAbility Checks\\nAn ability check tests a character&#x27;s or monster&#x27;s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.\\nThe more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success---the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\\nContests\\nSometimes one character&#x27;s or monster&#x27;s efforts are directly opposed to another&#x27;s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal---for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest.\\nThat character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it.

In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\\nSkills\\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual&#x27;s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character&#x27;s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster&#x27;s skill proficiencies appear in the monster&#x27;s stat block.)  For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character&#x27;s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability&#x27;s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\\nStrength\\n\\nAthletics\\n\\nDexterity\\n- Acrobatics\\n- Sleight of Hand\\n- Stealth\\nIntelligence\\n\\nArcana\\nHistory\\nInvestigation\\nNature\\nReligion\\n\\nWisdom\\n\\nAnimal Handling\\nInsight\\nMedicine\\nPerception\\nSurvival\\n\\nCharisma\\n\\nDeception\\nIntimidation\\nPerformance\\nPersuasion\\n\\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill---for example, Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character&#x27;s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\\nVariant: Skills with Different Abilities\\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you&#x27;re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as", "doc_id": "bf7fcf04-a4bb-47ee-bf88-26cb3bebf410", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "49cc6940c5b33fd5db728aef088159052bb93bd8b8299a71d3d1884190750b8a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 59127, "end": 63034}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "485b7f05-344d-4872-9a54-3e3c655112e4", "3": "b1821cf3-2229-4d5d-bcb2-107a0a195e70"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1821cf3-2229-4d5d-bcb2-107a0a195e70": {"__data__": {"text": "in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check.

So if you&#x27;re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\\nPassive Checks\\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn&#x27;t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\\nHere&#x27;s how to determine a character&#x27;s total for a passive check:  &amp;gt; 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check  If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\\nThe rules on hiding in the Dexterity section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\\nWorking Together\\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who&#x27;s leading the effort---or the one with the highest ability modifier---can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves&#x27; tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can&#x27;t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\\nGroup Checks\\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren&#x27;t.\\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.\\nOtherwise, the group fails.\\nGroup checks don&#x27;t come up very often, and they&#x27;re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\\nStrength\\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical", "doc_id": "b1821cf3-2229-4d5d-bcb2-107a0a195e70", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "183b69ff0a5745f157e0caac0fd3d816658b9f07988b76897124965c12347c88", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 63045, "end": 67038}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "bf7fcf04-a4bb-47ee-bf88-26cb3bebf410", "3": "88226017-f378-48ed-b611-aa34caaac5ab"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "88226017-f378-48ed-b611-aa34caaac5ab": {"__data__": {"text": "come up very often, and they&#x27;re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group.

This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\\nStrength\\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\\nStrength Checks\\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\\nAthletics\\nYour Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:  - You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while   scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to   knock you off.\\n- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt   midjump.\\n- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents,   storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature   tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with   your swimming.\\nOther Strength Checks\\nThe GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door - Break free of bonds - Push through a tunnel that is too small - Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it - Tip over a statue - Keep a boulder from rolling\\nAttack Rolls and Damage\\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\\nLifting and Carrying\\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don&#x27;t usually have to worry about it.\\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score).\\nWhile pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature&#x27;s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\\nVariant: Encumbrance\\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.\\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or", "doc_id": "88226017-f378-48ed-b611-aa34caaac5ab", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2dbd0e3cb86aef8a9f1e4b7a5bd0a9bd970fff2581cdbff19fa57642a11bf248", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 67032, "end": 70925}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "b1821cf3-2229-4d5d-bcb2-107a0a195e70", "3": "3f97648f-287b-433f-9127-4f78e0d19469"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f97648f-287b-433f-9127-4f78e0d19469": {"__data__": {"text": "carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift.

The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\\nAcrobatics\\nYour Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you&#x27;re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship&#x27;s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\\nSleight of Hand\\nWhenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person&#x27;s pocket.\\nStealth\\nMake a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\\nOther Dexterity Checks\\nThe GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent - Steer a chariot around a tight turn - Pick a lock - Disable a trap - Securely tie up a prisoner - Wriggle free of bonds - Play a stringed instrument - Craft a small or detailed object  Hiding  The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check&#x27;s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\\nYou can&#x27;t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you.\\nHowever, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\\nPassive Perception. When you hide, there&#x27;s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren&#x27;t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature&#x27;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10  - the", "doc_id": "3f97648f-287b-433f-9127-4f78e0d19469", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c1de986d3d05464321ac5108a2d9f70b7ed33ac8b8d1b760969ed9147885127b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 70927, "end": 74629}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "88226017-f378-48ed-b611-aa34caaac5ab", "3": "83fc06cb-e2b6-41b8-b406-2360681262cf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "83fc06cb-e2b6-41b8-b406-2360681262cf": {"__data__": {"text": "always try to hide.

When you hide, there&#x27;s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren&#x27;t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature&#x27;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10  - the creature&#x27;s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or   penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,   subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency   bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in   Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in the-environment.\\nAttack Rolls and Damage\\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\\nArmor Class\\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\\nInitiative\\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures&#x27; turns in combat.\\nConstitution\\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\\nConstitution Checks\\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\\nThe GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Hold your breath - March or labor for hours without rest - Go without sleep - Survive without food or water - Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go  #### Hit Points\\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you&#x27;re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\\nIntelligence\\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\\nIntelligence Checks\\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\\nArcana\\nYour Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those", "doc_id": "83fc06cb-e2b6-41b8-b406-2360681262cf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "92132b0307a10d019e07cacea5e68c7a144a043a568b7373109c0ddc81ad3580", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 74689, "end": 78607}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "3f97648f-287b-433f-9127-4f78e0d19469", "3": "1916e9d0-0a70-4c0e-b380-674b9758a746"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1916e9d0-0a70-4c0e-b380-674b9758a746": {"__data__": {"text": "then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier.

You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\\nNature\\nYour Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\\nReligion\\nYour Intelligence (Religion) check  measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\\nOther Intelligence Checks\\nThe GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Communicate with a creature without using words - Estimate the value of a precious item - Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard - Forge a document - Recall lore about a craft or trade - Win a game of skill\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\nWisdom\\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\\nWisdom Checks\\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone&#x27;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\\nAnimal Handling\\nWhen there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal&#x27;s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\\nInsight\\nYour Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone&#x27;s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\\nMedicine\\nA Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\\nPerception\\nYour Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret", "doc_id": "1916e9d0-0a70-4c0e-b380-674b9758a746", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ee2756a4c6679d4fe36605e9415d1257ef931e50225ceb05a832e2ed380ea018", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 78551, "end": 82504}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "83fc06cb-e2b6-41b8-b406-2360681262cf", "3": "5b8c3e8e-4cfc-4a95-9f43-0a26329135b3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b8c3e8e-4cfc-4a95-9f43-0a26329135b3": {"__data__": {"text": "Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\\nMedicine\\nA Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\\nPerception\\nYour Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.

It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\\nCharisma Checks\\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\\nDeception\\nYour Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone&#x27;s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\\nIntimidation\\nWhen you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\\nPerformance\\nYour Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\\nPersuasion\\nWhen you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk\\nOther Charisma Checks\\nThe GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n\\nFind the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip\\nBlend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\\n\\nSpellcasting Ability\\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\n',", "doc_id": "5b8c3e8e-4cfc-4a95-9f43-0a26329135b3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b4493d29e3bc5c31854826246825fe39346d70ca635a71bf1029a7d8d5bb0be4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 82547, "end": 86433}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "1916e9d0-0a70-4c0e-b380-674b9758a746", "3": "73225e5a-3c6a-404e-ab22-50a72b7202e6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "73225e5a-3c6a-404e-ab22-50a72b7202e6": {"__data__": {"text": "check.

Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\\nTypes of Actions\\nAttack\\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the Making an Attack section for the rules that govern attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\\nCast a Spell\\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\\nDash\\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\\nDisengage\\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn&#x27;t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\\nDodge\\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\\nHelp\\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task.\\nWhen you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally&#x27;s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\\nHide\\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding.

Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &#x27;If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I&#x27;ll pull the lever that opens it,&#x27; and &#x27;If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.&#x27;\\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell&#x27;s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the srd:web spell and ready srd:magic-missile, your srd:web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release srd:magic-missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\\nSearch\\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\\nUse an Object\\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.\\n', 'name': 'Actions in Combat', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'actions-in-combat'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\\nAdventuring Gear\\nThis section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.\\nAcid.

Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\\nThese brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\\nLawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.\\nNeutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.\\nChaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\\nLawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.\\nNeutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don&#x27;t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.\\nChaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.\\nLawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.\\nNeutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.

Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.\\nChaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.\\nAlignment in the Multiverse\\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.\\nThe evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god&#x27;s influence.)\\nAlignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn&#x27;t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.\\nMost creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.\\n', 'name': 'Alignment', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'alignment'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\\nArmor\\nFantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.\\nArmor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor&#x27;s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can&#x27;t cast spells.\\nArmor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.\\nHeavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer&#x27;s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \u201cStr 13\u201d or \u201cStr 15\u201d in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor", "doc_id": "24a7549a-61a8-4899-9420-0275495b38a3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cb011cd509768b417823a65911d6da81188b593a961a3ea93dd2101cb5e86304", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 101561, "end": 105359}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "ac1b3df7-009e-4af9-8af7-76926cad2462", "3": "b291efa3-9dad-48f1-9e46-c5325f2317bf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b291efa3-9dad-48f1-9e46-c5325f2317bf": {"__data__": {"text": "Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm.

Heavier armor interferes with the wearer&#x27;s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \u201cStr 13\u201d or \u201cStr 15\u201d in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer&#x27;s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\\nStealth. If the Armor table shows \u201cDisadvantage\u201d in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\\nShields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.\\nLight Armor\\nMade from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\\nPadded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.\\nLeather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.\\nStudded Leather. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.\\nMedium Armor\\nMedium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\\nHide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.\\nChain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer&#x27;s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.\\nScale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.\\nBreastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer&#x27;s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.\\nHalf Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer&#x27;s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.\\nHeavy Armor\\nOf all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.\\nHeavy armor doesn&#x27;t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn&#x27;t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\\nRing Mail.

Pick a target within your attack&#x27;s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\\nDetermine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\\nResolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\\n\\nIf there&#x27;s ever any question whether something you&#x27;re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you&#x27;re making an attack roll, you&#x27;re making an attack.\\nAttack Rolls\\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target&#x27;s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\\nModifiers to the Roll\\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character&#x27;s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\\nAbility Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\\nSome spells also require an attack roll.

This is called a critical hit.\\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target&#x27;s AC.\\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\\nCombatants often try to escape their foes&#x27; notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\\nWhen you attack a target that you can&#x27;t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you&#x27;re guessing the target&#x27;s location or you&#x27;re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn&#x27;t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target&#x27;s location correctly.\\nWhen a creature can&#x27;t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden---both unseen and unheard---when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\\nRanged Attacks\\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\\nRange\\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can&#x27;t attack a target beyond this range.\\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can&#x27;t attack a target beyond the long range.\\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn&#x27;t incapacitated.\\nMelee Attacks\\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.\\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\\nOpportunity Attacks\\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\\nYou can make an", "doc_id": "4e697a76-1a19-4f37-acbb-0d76a8f8ea72", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cd701ad996c54ea4679dcb6efd50395b3e7f65ef1d08ca7964dab7e92dddb28a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 115380, "end": 119107}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "8d7969ee-f617-4f8e-84ca-26f714c16a82", "3": "dfa22ca7-efab-4aae-8233-ae283c05ef5a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfa22ca7-efab-4aae-8233-ae283c05ef5a": {"__data__": {"text": "making a melee attack.\\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack.

You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\\nOpportunity Attacks\\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don&#x27;t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don&#x27;t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe&#x27;s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you&#x27;re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you&#x27;re holding in the other hand. You don&#x27;t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\\nGrappling\\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you&#x27;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&#x27;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the srd:grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\\n\\nContests in Combat\\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\\n\\nShoving a Creature\\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it srd:prone or push it away from you. If you&#x27;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.

Your character&#x27;s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.\\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character&#x27;s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don&#x27;t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?\\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.\\nProficiencies\\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in \u201cUsing Ability Scores\u201d).\\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in \u201cEquipment\u201d).\\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.\\nLanguages\\nSome backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See \u201cLanguages.\u201d\\nEquipment\\nEach background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.\\nSuggested Characteristics\\nA background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.\\nCustomizing a Background\\nYou might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can&#x27;t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw.

When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\\nLifestyle Expenses\\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.\\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn&#x27;t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\\nDowntime Activities\\nBetween adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\\nCrafting\\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan&#x27;s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.\\nFor example, someone proficient with smith&#x27;s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the item.\\nFor example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal", "doc_id": "f17f59ec-fb95-4184-a4b4-6fbf222c5ef8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8297dc707fa6083d1ba25ba20d87db16ceeb3adf060c903e3550b05675907d98", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 126921, "end": 131020}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "e26b4a80-df93-4847-a1e5-5652d85dfae0", "3": "8caffb23-1d74-40e0-a3d2-f01686f6122e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8caffb23-1d74-40e0-a3d2-f01686f6122e": {"__data__": {"text": "something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the item.\\nFor example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place.

Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone&#x27;s aid.

Your GM might allow additional training options.\\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you.

In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn&#x27;t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\\nIf you&#x27;re surprised, you can&#x27;t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can&#x27;t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren&#x27;t.\\nInitiative\\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.\\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\\nYour Turn\\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed---sometimes called your walking speed---is noted on your character sheet.\\nThe most common actions you can take are described in srd:actions-in-combat. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\\nsrd:movement-and-position gives the rules for your move.\\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can&#x27;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in srd:actions-in-combat.\\nBonus Actions\\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action.

If you can&#x27;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in srd:actions-in-combat.\\nBonus Actions\\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don&#x27;t have a bonus action to take.\\n\\nSage Advice\\nActions and bonus actions can&#x27;t be exchanged. If you have two abilities that require bonus actions to activate you can only use one, even if you take no other actions.\\nSource: Sage Advice &amp;gt; Compendium\\n\\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action&#x27;s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\\nOther Activity on Your Turn\\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\\nReactions\\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else&#x27;s. The opportunity attack  is the most common type of reaction.\\nWhen you take a reaction, you can&#x27;t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature&#x27;s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\\n', 'name': 'Combat Sequence', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'combat-sequence'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\\nConditions\\nConditions alter a creature&#x27;s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster&#x27;s attack, or other effect.

A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\\nThere are three degrees of cover.

The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a srd:fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\\nHit Points\\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\\nA creature&#x27;s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature&#x27;s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature&#x27;s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\\nDamage Rolls\\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.

For example, when a wizard casts srd:fireball or a cleric casts srd:flame-strike, the spell&#x27;s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\\nCritical Hits\\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack&#x27;s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack&#x27;s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue&#x27;s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\\nDamage Types\\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon&#x27;s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks---hammers, falling, constriction, and the like---deal bludgeoning damage.\\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil&#x27;s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon&#x27;s breath deal cold damage.\\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon&#x27;s breath deal lightning damage.\\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters&#x27; bites, deal piercing damage.\\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon&#x27;s breath deal poison damage.\\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer&#x27;s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric&#x27;s flame strike spell or an angel&#x27;s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters&#x27; claws deal slashing damage.\\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the srd:thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it.

A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the srd:thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three--- quarters.\\nHealing\\nUnless it results in death, damage isn&#x27;t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature&#x27;s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature&#x27;s hit points can&#x27;t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\\nA creature that has died can&#x27;t regain hit points until magic such as the srd:revivify spell has restored it to life.\\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall srd:unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\\nInstant Death\\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\\nFalling Unconscious\\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall srd:unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\\nDeath Saving Throws\\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn&#x27;t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don&#x27;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\\nRolling 1 or 20.

Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don&#x27;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\\nStabilizing a Creature\\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn&#x27;t killed by a failed death saving throw.\\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an srd:unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. A stable creature doesn&#x27;t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain srd:unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn&#x27;t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\\nMonsters and Death\\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall srd:unconscious and make death saving throws. Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall srd:unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\\nKnocking a Creature Out\\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls srd:unconscious and is stable.\\nTemporary Hit Points\\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren&#x27;t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\\nHealing can&#x27;t restore temporary hit points, and they can&#x27;t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn&#x27;t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you&#x27;re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they&#x27;re depleted or you finish a long", "doc_id": "8b21a246-41d7-405f-887b-8a3d7bd98061", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fbc2684a1bd9a9d4495ac4e0df906d0f9183026b23d3c7a8c69d40cef0f6934e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 164247, "end": 168102}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "94380b0d-7d50-4a7d-b252-1ab815dfc4af", "3": "d805d168-f27a-40bb-8678-c1905accf070"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d805d168-f27a-40bb-8678-c1905accf070": {"__data__": {"text": "receive temporary hit points.\\nHealing can&#x27;t restore temporary hit points, and they can&#x27;t be added together.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren&#x27;t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\\nSample Diseases\\nThe diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\\nCackle Fever\\nThis disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \u201cthe shrieks.\u201d\\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can&#x27;t be removed until the disease is cured.\\nAny event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6.

On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\\nSewer Plague\\nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague&#x27;s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character&#x27;s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature&#x27;s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\\nSight Rot\\nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature&#x27;s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\\n', 'name': 'Diseases', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'diseases'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\\nEnvironment\\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored.

Darknessand other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage,creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely onsight.\\nA heavily obscured area---such as darkness, opaque fog, or densefoliage---blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers fromthe blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates threecategories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy daysprovide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sourcesof illumination within a specific radius.\\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. Anarea of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of brightlight, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light oftwilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliantfull moon might bathe the land in dim light.\\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darknessoutdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of anunlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magicaldarkness.\\nBlindsight\\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relyingon sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such asoozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such asbats and true dragons, have this sense.\\nDarkvision\\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwellunderground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature withdarkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, soareas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature isconcerned. However, the creature can&#x27;t discern color in darkness, onlyshades of gray.\\nTruesight\\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normaland magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects,automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throwsagainst them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or acreature that is", "doc_id": "618cc3f1-5631-4689-9f0b-9e43ca5aeb00", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "53d63d687aa738470df94923b847d8aa052952904b4cc2bee6c323c08e752d55", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 175671, "end": 179446}, "relationships": {"1": "c8b2dc95-82cd-4994-8e9a-6284e9f04330", "2": "0ee56fc4-7a34-4848-b34c-9fa809339d96", "3": "9999f96c-d2a1-423b-af6a-5ff2f2b0d20a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9999f96c-d2a1-423b-af6a-5ff2f2b0d20a": {"__data__": {"text": "with echolocation or heightened senses, such asbats and true dragons, have this sense.\\nDarkvision\\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwellunderground, have darkvision.

Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can&#x27;t beremoved until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\\nFood\\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can make food lastlonger by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in aday counts as half a day without food.\\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his orher Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyondthat limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\\nWater\\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day ifthe weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much watermust succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to evenless water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\\nInteracting with Objects\\nA character&#x27;s interaction with objects in an environment is often simpleto resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or hercharacter is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.\\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, inturn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open asecret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position,though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrenchthe lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on thedifficulty of the task.\\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.\\nObjects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they canbe affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. TheGM determines an object&#x27;s Armor Class and hit points, and might decidethat certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds ofattacks. (It&#x27;s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objectsalways fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune toeffects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points,it breaks.\\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object.

You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\\nSqualid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.\\nPoor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\\nModest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don&#x27;t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\\nComfortable.

You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses.

You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility.

Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\\nSkilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.\\nServices (table)\\n\\n\\n\\nService Pay\\nPay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoach cab\\n\\n\\n\\n- Between towns\\n3 cp per mile\\n\\n\\n- Within a city\\n1 cp\\n\\n\\nHireling\\n\\n\\n\\n- Skilled\\n2 gp per day\\n\\n\\n- Untrained\\n2 sp per day\\n\\n\\nMessenger\\n2 cp per mile\\n\\n\\nRoad or gate toll\\n1 cp\\n\\n\\nShip&#x27;s passage\\n1 sp per mile\\n\\n\\n\\nSpellcasting Services\\nPeople who are able to cast spells don&#x27;t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings.

Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities---a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.\\n\\nThe three main rolls of the game---the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll---rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number\\n\\n## Ability Scores and Modifiers\\n\\n Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.\\n\\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\\n\\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\\n\\n  To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\\n\\n Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\\n\\n## Advantage and Disadvantage\\n\\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.\\nWhen that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\\n\\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20.\\nIf two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\\n\\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\\n\\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\\n\\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\\n\\n## Proficiency Bonus  \\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this", "doc_id": "b8ae417a-efb5-45f1-a70b-e251e8387a82", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3bca81646c4d721e5451a97688ec3c3d568f43e9cbb0e147c66d06acea13c767", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3906}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "3": "253815c8-4f66-4fef-a084-36a98820c9c6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "253815c8-4f66-4fef-a084-36a98820c9c6": {"__data__": {"text": "you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling's Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice.

Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\\n\\n## Proficiency Bonus  \\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\\n\\nYour proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\\n\\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue's Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\\n\\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\\n\\nIn general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\\n\\n## Ability Checks  \\nAn ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\\n\\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.\\n\\nThe more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\\n\\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success---the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\\n\\n### Contests  \\nSometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal---for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\\n\\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks.", "doc_id": "253815c8-4f66-4fef-a084-36a98820c9c6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d285809409d62dcd31c112125dc724d469fbc1bd3ede0fe93502d909fdc95017", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3287, "end": 7349}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "b8ae417a-efb5-45f1-a70b-e251e8387a82", "3": "f148f1bd-92e5-45ad-a5de-3dff6d8d0d6d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f148f1bd-92e5-45ad-a5de-3dff6d8d0d6d": {"__data__": {"text": "GM.\\n\\n### Contests  \\nSometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's.

The participant with the higher check total wins the contest.\\nThat character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\\n\\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\\n\\n### Skills\\n\\n Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)  For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\\n\\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\\n\\n**Strength**\\n\\n- Athletics\\n\\n**Dexterity**\\n- Acrobatics\\n- Sleight of Hand\\n- Stealth\\n\\n**Intelligence**\\n\\n- Arcana\\n- History\\n- Investigation\\n- Nature\\n- Religion\\n\\n**Wisdom**\\n\\n- Animal Handling\\n- Insight\\n- Medicine\\n- Perception\\n- Survival\\n\\n**Charisma**\\n\\n- Deception\\n- Intimidation\\n- Performance\\n- Persuasion\\n\\n\\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill---for example, Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\\n\\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\\n\\n#### Variant: Skills with Different Abilities  \\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check.

Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\\n\\n### Passive Checks  \\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\\n\\nHere's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:  > 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check  If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.\\n\\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\\n\\nThe rules on hiding in the Dexterity section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\\n\\n### Working Together  \\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort---or the one with the highest ability modifier---can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\\n\\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\\n\\n#### Group Checks  \\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.\\n\\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.\\nOtherwise, the group fails.\\n\\nGroup checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are", "doc_id": "8d233cd8-da7a-4283-b2ba-a80bd87bfd0b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "50de48d2fed686f1e27a191dc4d0725bc0d069432679dec20a1233fd2e6ea82f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11175, "end": 15238}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "f148f1bd-92e5-45ad-a5de-3dff6d8d0d6d", "3": "c7b04512-51b6-45aa-bd2d-d4ec801ca29c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7b04512-51b6-45aa-bd2d-d4ec801ca29c": {"__data__": {"text": "trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check.

If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\\n\\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\\n\\n### Strength  \\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\\n\\n#### Strength Checks  \\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\\n\\n##### Athletics  \\nYour Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:  - You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while   scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to   knock you off.\\n- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt   midjump.\\n- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents,   storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature   tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with   your swimming.\\n\\n##### Other Strength Checks  \\nThe GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door - Break free of bonds - Push through a tunnel that is too small - Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it - Tip over a statue - Keep a boulder from rolling\\n\\n\\n#### Attack Rolls and Damage\\n\\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\\n\\n#### Lifting and Carrying  \\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\\n\\n**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.\\n\\n**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score).\\nWhile pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\\n\\n**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\\n\\n#### Variant: Encumbrance  \\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple.

For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\\n\\n#### Variant: Encumbrance  \\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.\\n\\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are **encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\\n\\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\\n\\n### Dexterity \\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\\n\\n#### Dexterity Checks\\n\\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\\n\\n##### Acrobatics  \\nYour Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\\n\\n##### Sleight of Hand  \\nWhenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.\\n\\n##### Stealth  \\nMake a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\\n\\n##### Other Dexterity Checks  \\nThe GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent - Steer a chariot around a tight turn - Pick a lock - Disable a trap - Securely tie up a prisoner - Wriggle free of bonds - Play a stringed instrument - Craft a small or detailed object  **Hiding**  The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\\n\\nYou can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\\n\\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\\n\\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a", "doc_id": "a2257beb-9925-4d9d-80fa-1e866f69a7b9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b29350cc1a0f05d9db55423d3fc674e0dbd2bdaca54f59fa1605b40f4ad3a44a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19123, "end": 22836}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "c7b04512-51b6-45aa-bd2d-d4ec801ca29c", "3": "32f96eba-c506-4288-a1d4-3aa5fc1de422"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "32f96eba-c506-4288-a1d4-3aa5fc1de422": {"__data__": {"text": "Craft a small or detailed object  **Hiding**  The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding.

Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\\n\\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you.\\nHowever, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\\n\\n**Passive Perception.** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10  - the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or   penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,   subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency   bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in   Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\\n\\n**What Can You See?** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in the-environment.\\n\\n#### Attack Rolls and Damage\\n\\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\\n\\n#### Armor Class  \\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\\n\\n#### Initiative  \\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.\\n\\n### Constitution  \\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\\n\\n#### Constitution Checks  \\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\\n\\nThe GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Hold your breath - March or labor for hours without rest - Go without sleep - Survive without food or water - Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go  #### Hit Points  \\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\\n\\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2.

The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\\n\\n##### Arcana  \\nYour Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\\n\\n##### History  \\nYour Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\\n\\n##### Investigation\\n\\nWhen you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\\n\\n##### Nature  \\nYour Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\\n\\n##### Religion\\n\\nYour Intelligence (Religion) check  measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\\n\\n##### Other Intelligence Checks  \\nThe GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Communicate with a creature without using words - Estimate the value of a precious item - Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard - Forge a document - Recall lore about a craft or trade - Win a game of skill\\n\\n#### Spellcasting Ability  \\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\n\\n### Wisdom  \\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\\n\\n#### Wisdom Checks  \\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\\n\\n##### Animal Handling  \\nWhen there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\\n\\n##### Insight  \\nYour Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move.

Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\\n\\n##### Medicine  \\nA Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\\n\\n##### Perception  \\nYour Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\\n\\n##### Survival  \\nThe GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\\n\\n##### Other Wisdom Checks  \\nThe GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow - Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead  #### Spellcasting Ability  \\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\\n\\n### Charisma\\n\\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\\n\\n#### Charisma Checks\\n\\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\\n\\n##### Deception\\n\\nYour Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\\n\\n##### Intimidation  \\nWhen you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\\n\\n##### Performance  \\nYour Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\\n\\n##### Persuasion", "doc_id": "2c915996-e5ea-45f5-b0e6-665d8a40d91f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f5d9cf4b85c48f0dd5b24978555b1d11df5c8edd84c08c79da3c5d048bf2ee07", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 30714, "end": 34563}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "c3484684-d52f-4f66-9839-71a4c8da184f", "3": "8649127f-4a42-4d50-b917-11cf523d3afe"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8649127f-4a42-4d50-b917-11cf523d3afe": {"__data__": {"text": "yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\\n\\n##### Intimidation  \\nWhen you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check.

Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk\\n\\n##### Other Charisma Checks\\n\\nThe GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\\n\\n- Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip\\n- Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\\n\\n\\n#### Spellcasting Ability\\n\\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd', 'parent': 'Gameplay Mechanics'}, {'slug': 'actions-in-combat', 'name': 'Actions in Combat', 'desc': \"When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\\n\\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\\n\\n## Types of Actions\\n\\n### Attack\\n\\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\\n\\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the Making an Attack section for the rules that govern attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\\n\\n### Cast a Spell\\n\\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\\n\\n### Dash\\n\\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn.

Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\\n\\n### Dash\\n\\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers.

Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\\n\\n### Help\\n\\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task.\\n\\nWhen you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\\n\\n### Hide\\n\\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in srd:unseen-attackers-and-targets.\\n\\n### Ready\\n\\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\\n\\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include 'If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,' and 'If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.'\\n\\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\\n\\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the srd:web spell and ready srd:magic-missile, your srd:web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release srd:magic-missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\\n\\n### Search\\n\\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something.

Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.\\n\\nThe evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil.

For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\\n\\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.\\n\\n**_Armor Proficiency._** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.\\n\\n**_Armor Class (AC)._** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.\\n\\n**_Heavy Armor._** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows \u201cStr 13\u201d or \u201cStr 15\u201d in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\\n\\n**_Stealth._** If the Armor table shows \u201cDisadvantage\u201d in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\\n\\n**_Shields._** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.\\n\\n## Light Armor\\n\\nMade from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility.

If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\\n\\n**_Hide._** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.\\n\\n**_Chain Shirt._** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.\\n\\n**_Scale Mail._** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.\\n\\n**_Breastplate._** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.\\n\\n**_Half Plate._** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.\\n\\n## Heavy Armor\\n\\nOf all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.\\n\\nHeavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\\n\\n**_Ring Mail._** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.\\n\\n**_Chain Mail._** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.\\n\\n**_Splint._** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.\\n\\n**_Plate._** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body.

Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\\n\\n\\nIf there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.\\n\\n## Attack Rolls\\n\\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\\n\\n### Modifiers to the Roll\\n\\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\\n\\n**Ability Modifier.** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\\n\\nSome spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\\n\\n**Proficiency Bonus.** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.\\n\\n### Rolling 1 or 20\\n\\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\\n\\n> **Sage Advice**\\n\\n> Spell attacks can score critical hits, just like any other attack.\\n\\n> \\n\\n> Source: [Sage Advice > Compendium\\n\\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit.\\n\\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\\n\\n## Unseen Attackers and Targets\\n\\nCombatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\\n\\nWhen you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.\\n\\nWhen a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden---both unseen and unheard---when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\\n\\n## Ranged Attacks\\n\\n When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\\n\\n### Range\\n\\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.\\n\\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.\\n\\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.\\n\\n### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat\\n\\n Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.\\n\\n## Melee Attacks\\n\\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.\\n\\nMost creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\\n\\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\\n\\n### Opportunity Attacks\\n\\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\\n\\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\\n\\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\\n\\n### Two-Weapon Fighting\\n\\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\\n\\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\\n\\n### Grappling\\n\\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n\\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach.

Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the srd:grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\\n\\n**Escaping a Grapple.** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\\n\\n **Moving a Grappled Creature.** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\\n\\n > **Contests in Combat**\\n\\n > Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\\n\\n\\n### Shoving a Creature\\n\\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it srd:prone or push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\\n\\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).

Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\\n\\n Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible.

You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.\\n\\nFor example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\\n\\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the item.\\n\\nFor example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\\n\\n Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\\n\\n While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\\n\\n### Practicing a Profession\\n\\nYou can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\\n\\nIf you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\\n\\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\\n\\n### Recuperating  \\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\\n\\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\\n\\n- End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.\\n- For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.\\n\\n\\n### Researching\\n\\nThe time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have", "doc_id": "508479ec-803b-41a0-b3f5-6ece2e3f90c0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4dfa29238a722be0e81f8b67f6cae30499512cafac53a5f507a37ca789d5cdc0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 80947, "end": 85031}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "7e5d0f8f-bf99-4499-867a-da0273b593a5", "3": "059ddc2b-957b-43e4-bb38-63a461d19e77"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "059ddc2b-957b-43e4-bb38-63a461d19e77": {"__data__": {"text": "proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\\n\\n### Recuperating  \\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\\n\\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\\n\\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\\n\\nFor each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses.\\n\\nThis cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\\n\\n### Training\\n\\nYou can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\\n\\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\\n\\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd', 'parent': 'Gameplay Mechanics'}, {'slug': 'coins', 'name': 'Coins', 'desc': \"Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made.

A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\\n\\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\\n\\nIf you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.\\n\\n## Initiative\\n\\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\\n\\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.\\n\\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\\n\\n## Your Turn\\n\\nOn your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed---sometimes called your walking speed---is noted on your character sheet.\\n\\nThe most common actions you can take are described in srd:actions-in-combat. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\\n\\nsrd:movement-and-position gives the rules for your move.\\n\\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in srd:actions-in-combat.\\n\\n### Bonus Actions\\n\\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action.

For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\\n\\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\\n\\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\\n\\n## Reactions\\n\\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack  is the most common type of reaction.\\n\\nWhen you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn.

The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a srd:fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\\n\\n## Hit Points\\n\\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\\n\\nA creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0.

With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage. When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier---the same modifier used for the attack roll---to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\\n\\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to **more** **than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts srd:fireball or a cleric casts srd:flame-strike, the spell's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\\n\\n### Critical Hits\\n\\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\\n\\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\\n\\n### Damage Types\\n\\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\\n\\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\\n\\n**Acid.** The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\\n\\n**Bludgeoning.** Blunt force attacks---hammers, falling, constriction, and the like---deal bludgeoning damage.\\n\\n**Cold.** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.\\n\\n**Fire.** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\\n\\n**Force.** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including _magic missile_ and _spiritual weapon_.\\n\\n**Lightning.** A _lightning bolt_ spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.\\n\\n**Necrotic.** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as _chill touch_, withers matter and even the soul.\\n\\n**Piercing.** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.\\n\\n**Poison.** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.\\n\\n**Psychic.** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage.\\n\\n**Radiant.** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's _flame strike_ spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\\n\\n**Slashing.** Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.\\n\\n**Thunder.** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the srd:thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\\n\\n## Damage Resistance and Vulnerability\\n\\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\\n\\nIf a creature or an object has", "doc_id": "6f464c9d-b13b-42fc-bcfb-f53980e6af8a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6dfbbaecd955e3bc6df4cabbd4cae4c53fcfa154edf064a2400e0c6b91812769", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 110338, "end": 114005}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "f066fc36-fe53-406c-861b-a5d31b286b13", "3": "105a5319-e613-4131-b281-646651e6161e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "105a5319-e613-4131-b281-646651e6161e": {"__data__": {"text": "of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.\\n\\n**Psychic.** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage.\\n\\n**Radiant.** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's _flame strike_ spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\\n\\n**Slashing.** Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.\\n\\n**Thunder.** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the srd:thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\\n\\n## Damage Resistance and Vulnerability\\n\\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\\n\\nIf a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\\n\\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\\n\\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three--- quarters.\\n\\n## Healing\\n\\nUnless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such as a _cure wounds_ spell or a _potion of healing_ can remove damage in an instant.\\n\\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\\n\\nA creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic such as the srd:revivify spell has restored it to life.\\n\\n## Dropping to 0 Hit Points\\n\\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall srd:unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\\n\\n### Instant Death\\n\\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\\n\\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\\n\\n### Falling Unconscious\\n\\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall srd:unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\\n\\n### Death Saving Throws\\n\\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\\n\\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.

You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\\n\\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\\n\\n**Rolling 1 or 20.** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\\n\\n**Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\\n\\n### Stabilizing a Creature\\n\\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.\\n\\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an srd:unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. A **stable** creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain srd:unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\\n\\n### Monsters and Death\\n\\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall srd:unconscious and make death saving throws. Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall srd:unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\\n\\n## Knocking a Creature Out\\n\\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls srd:unconscious and is stable.\\n\\n## Temporary Hit Points\\n\\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. _For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage._ Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\\n\\nHealing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\\n\\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.

An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\\n\\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of _lesser restoration_. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\\n\\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\\n\\n## Sample Diseases\\n\\nThe diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\\n\\n### Cackle Fever\\n\\nThis disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: \u201cthe shrieks.\u201d\\n\\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\\n\\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the", "doc_id": "409665db-2296-4dfd-9e97-e71cc25bee85", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f50ac1082d4967e5ff5490e3a134964244a5b7e3eb7d80840072e704ba99c2a8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 121707, "end": 125537}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "0ae26175-f3bf-4688-afd0-e2340a1d9325", "3": "e3e5f893-ab1f-4cf5-97ed-32e062959e0e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3e5f893-ab1f-4cf5-97ed-32e062959e0e": {"__data__": {"text": "and disorientation.

On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\\n\\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\\n\\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\\n\\n### Sewer Plague\\n\\nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\\n\\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\\n\\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\\n\\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\\n\\n### Sight Rot\\n\\nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\\n\\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as _lesser restoration_ or _heal_.\\n\\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps.

The rules in thissection cover some of the most important ways in which adventurersinteract with the environment in such places.\\n## Falling \\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing anadventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoningdamage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creaturelands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\\n## Suffocating\\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + itsConstitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for anumber of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and isdying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it canbreathe again.\\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breathfor 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach airbefore it drops to 0 hit points.\\n## Vision and Light\\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring---noticing danger, findinghidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, toname just a few---rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darknessand other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage,creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely onsight.\\nA **heavily obscured** area---such as darkness, opaque fog, or densefoliage---blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers fromthe blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates threecategories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\\n**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy daysprovide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sourcesof illumination within a specific radius.\\n**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. Anarea of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of brightlight, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light oftwilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliantfull moon might bathe the land in dim light.\\n**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darknessoutdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of anunlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magicaldarkness.\\n### Blindsight\\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relyingon sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such asoozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such asbats and true dragons, have this sense.\\n\\n### Darkvision\\n\\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwellunderground, have darkvision.

Creatures without eyes, such asoozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such asbats and true dragons, have this sense.\\n\\n### Darkvision\\n\\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwellunderground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature withdarkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, soareas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature isconcerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, onlyshades of gray.\\n### Truesight\\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normaland magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects,automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throwsagainst them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or acreature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can seeinto the Ethereal Plane.\\n\\n## Food and Water\\n\\nCharacters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't beremoved until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\\n### Food\\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can make food lastlonger by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in aday counts as half a day without food.\\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his orher Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyondthat limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\\n### Water\\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day ifthe weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much watermust succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to evenless water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\\n## Interacting with Objects\\nA character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simpleto resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or hercharacter is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.\\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, inturn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open asecret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position,though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrenchthe lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on thedifficulty of the task.\\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.\\nObjects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they canbe affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. TheGM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decidethat certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds ofattacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objectsalways fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune toeffects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points,it breaks.\\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object.

Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.\\n\\n## Lifestyle Expenses\\n\\nLifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\\n\\nAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.\\n\\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\\n\\n**Lifestyle Expenses (table)**\\n\\n| Lifestyle    | Price/Day     |\\n|--------------|---------------|\\n| Wretched     | -             |\\n| Squalid      | 1 sp          |\\n| Poor         | 2 sp          |\\n| Modest       | 1 gp          |\\n| Comfortable  | 2 gp          |\\n| Wealthy      | 4 gp          |\\n| Aristocratic | 10 gp minimum |\\n\\n**_Wretched._** You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\\n\\n**_Squalid._** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.\\n\\n**_Poor._** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience.

Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\\n\\n**_Modest._** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\\n\\n**_Comfortable._** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\\n\\n**_Wealthy._** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\\n\\n**_Aristocratic._** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\\n\\n> ### Self-Sufficiency\\n>\\n> The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\\n>\\n> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming.

Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.\\n\\n**Services (table)**\\n\\n| Service Pay       | Pay           |\\n|-------------------|---------------|\\n| **_Coach cab_**   |               |\\n| - Between towns   | 3 cp per mile |\\n| - Within a city   | 1 cp          |\\n| **_Hireling_**    |               |\\n| - Skilled         | 2 gp per day  |\\n| - Untrained       | 2 sp per day  |\\n| Messenger         | 2 cp per mile |\\n| Road or gate toll | 1 cp          |\\n| Ship's passage    | 1 sp per mile |\\n\\n## Spellcasting Services\\n\\nPeople who are able to cast spells don't fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\\n\\nHiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as *cure wounds* or *identify*, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url':", "doc_id": "16fee00c-cf40-400c-a1ca-890d94987931", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "86cd91de51a9b7be0754cd22bc2d838a3140a07fd9ecaf9e7843cf0f0c29f00c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 150477, "end": 153929}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "b7ca3cc4-10a1-4c8a-93bc-796735ea1941", "3": "c341d3ab-7e4d-4b4a-bea6-1e3de7569060"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c341d3ab-7e4d-4b4a-bea6-1e3de7569060": {"__data__": {"text": "more it costs.\\n\\nHiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as *cure wounds* or *identify*, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components).

A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called **gaining a level**.\\n\\nWhen your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can't increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.\\n\\nEach time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).\\n\\nWhen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4.

If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.\\n\\n## Going Mad\\n\\nVarious magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as _contact other plane_ and _symbol_, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells*.* Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\\n\\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.\\n\\n## Madness Effects\\n\\nMadness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.\\n\\nA character afflicted with **short-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.\\n\\nA character afflicted with **long-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 \u00d7 10 hours.\\n\\nA character afflicted with **indefinite madness** gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.\\n\\n**Short-Term Madness (table)**\\n| d100   | Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes)                                                                                                  |\\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| 01-20  | The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed.

You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.\\n\\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\\n\\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\\n\\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd', 'parent': 'Combat'}, {'slug': 'mounts-and-vehicles', 'name': 'Mounts and Vehicles', 'desc': \"A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down.

But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground---all considered difficult terrain.\\n\\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain---moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed---so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\\n\\n## Special Types of Movement\\n\\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim,or jump to get where they need to go.\\n\\n### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling\\n\\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing orswimming speed. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surfaceor one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require asuccessful Strength (Athletics) check.\\n\\n### Jumping\\n\\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\\n\\n**Long Jump.** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet upto your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediatelybefore the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap onlyhalf that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs afoot of movement.\\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as ajump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed ona DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no tallerthan a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall.\\nOtherwise, you hit it.\\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you landprone.\\n\\n**High Jump.** When", "doc_id": "2a207529-529e-43d8-aee1-bd4f993c733f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "da389cc16a3c8e9cbbc8db100b7a3fdba541f5c683029d4a017cc6f202ba3082", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 196511, "end": 200288}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "545209d0-bffa-4f8f-ba63-2082aa732436", "3": "42345d49-0728-4a28-8d91-688c6b8d2f9c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "42345d49-0728-4a28-8d91-688c6b8d2f9c": {"__data__": {"text": "you cover a number of feet upto your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediatelybefore the jump.

Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.\\n\\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.\\n\\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher- than-average ability scores.\\n\\n**Multiclassing Prerequisites (table)**\\n\\n| Class     | Ability Score Minimum       |\\n|-----------|-----------------------------|\\n| Barbarian | Strength 13                 |\\n| Bard      | Charisma 13                 |\\n| Cleric    | Wisdom 13                   |\\n| Druid     | Wisdom 13                   |\\n| Fighter   | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |\\n| Monk      | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |\\n| Paladin   | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |\\n| Ranger    |", "doc_id": "42345d49-0728-4a28-8d91-688c6b8d2f9c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d1446aa369a93fe566cb0907e318c4e2b91cd5945cb9bdf04fb45ef8f820bee7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 200322, "end": 203884}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "2a207529-529e-43d8-aee1-bd4f993c733f", "3": "6f07ecec-fba5-4650-9b5c-c1dc7fd1b584"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f07ecec-fba5-4650-9b5c-c1dc7fd1b584": {"__data__": {"text": "Score Minimum       |\\n|-----------|-----------------------------|\\n| Barbarian | Strength 13                 |\\n| Bard      | Charisma 13                 |\\n| Cleric    | Wisdom 13                   |\\n| Druid     | Wisdom 13                   |\\n| Fighter   | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |\\n| Monk      | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |\\n| Paladin   | Strength 13 and Charisma 13 |\\n| Ranger    | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13  |\\n| Rogue     | Dexterity 13                |\\n| Sorcerer  | Charisma 13                 |\\n| Warlock   | Charisma 13                 |\\n| Wizard    | Intelligence 13             |\\n\\n## Experience Points\\n\\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.\\n\\n## Hit Points and Hit Dice\\n\\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.\\n\\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\\n\\n# Proficiency Bonus\\n\\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th- level character, which is +3.\\n\\n# Proficiencies\\n\\nWhen you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\\n\\n**Multiclassing Proficiencies (table)**\\n\\n| Class     | Proficiencies Gained                                                                                       |\\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Barbarian | Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                                                   |\\n| Bard      | Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice                               |\\n| Cleric    | Light armor, medium armor, shields    ", "doc_id": "6f07ecec-fba5-4650-9b5c-c1dc7fd1b584", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7024d6738145ce2f9355198deffb87fbc5c56d804e1f616a89fe026b6ae3a0a9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 204239, "end": 206984}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "42345d49-0728-4a28-8d91-688c6b8d2f9c", "3": "f430dc9f-cb89-4753-96bb-d52fc75db88c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f430dc9f-cb89-4753-96bb-d52fc75db88c": {"__data__": {"text": "                          |\\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Barbarian | Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                                                   |\\n| Bard      | Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice                               |\\n| Cleric    | Light armor, medium armor, shields                                                                         |\\n| Druid     | Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)               |\\n| Fighter   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                        |\\n| Monk      | Simple weapons, shortswords                                                                                |\\n| Paladin   | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons                                        |\\n| Ranger    | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list |\\n| Rogue     | Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools                                         |\\n| Sorcerer  | -                                                                                                          |\\n| Warlock   | Light armor, simple weapons                                                                                |\\n| Wizard    | -                                                                                                          |\\n\\n## Class Features\\n\\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level.

You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\\n\\n## Channel Divinity\\n\\nIf you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\\n\\n## Extra Attack\\n\\nIf you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock's eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn't give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.\\n\\n## Unarmored Defense\\n\\nIf you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.\\n\\n## Spellcasting\\n\\nYour capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\\n\\n**_Spells Known and Prepared._** You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level ranger spells based on your levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.\\n\\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.\\n\\n**_Spell Slots._** You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\\n\\nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like _burning hands_, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.\\n\\nFor example, if you are the aforementioned", "doc_id": "331c01c7-b9de-4355-bc76-baaec716993a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4c7bd54cb1a03710e620e32f9c175978f65150c2402dec10c6417167c049246e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 208895, "end": 212540}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "f430dc9f-cb89-4753-96bb-d52fc75db88c", "3": "0053d82f-c57e-415f-b4cb-bc9511f0f76e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0053d82f-c57e-415f-b4cb-bc9511f0f76e": {"__data__": {"text": "You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes.

However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know-and potentially enhance their effects.\\n\\n**_Pact Magic._** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\\n\\n**Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level (table)**\\n\\n| Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th |\\n|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\\n| 1st   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 2nd   | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 3rd   | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 4th   | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 5th   | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 6th   | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 7th   | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 8th   | 4   | 3   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 9th   | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 10th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 11th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 12th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 13th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   |", "doc_id": "0053d82f-c57e-415f-b4cb-bc9511f0f76e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7a7003e5633b29e58722fea72a765396ca77a00f5c1f183e30a4230c98a8adc7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 212084, "end": 214640}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "331c01c7-b9de-4355-bc76-baaec716993a", "3": "9feb45a6-cefe-4f54-9b70-dcfaae485325"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9feb45a6-cefe-4f54-9b70-dcfaae485325": {"__data__": {"text": "-   |\\n| 9th   | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 10th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | -   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 11th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 12th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | -   | -   | -   |\\n| 13th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | -   | -   |\\n| 14th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | -   | -   |\\n| 15th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   | -   |\\n| 16th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   | -   |\\n| 17th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |\\n| 18th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |\\n| 19th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 1   | 1   |\\n| 20th  | 4   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 2   | 2   | 1   | 1   |\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd', 'parent': 'Character Advancement'}, {'slug': 'objects', 'name': 'Objects', 'desc': \"When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\\n\\nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\\n\\n## Statistics for Objects\\n\\nWhen time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\\n\\n**_Armor Class_**.

An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\\n\\n**Object Hit Points (table)**\\n\\n| Size                                  | Fragile  | Resilient |\\n|---------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\\n| Tiny (bottle, lock)                   | 2 (1d4)  | 5 (2d4)   |\\n| Small (chest, lute)                   | 3 (1d6)  | 10 (3d6)  |\\n| Medium (barrel, chandelier)           | 4 (1d8)  | 18 (4d8)  |\\n| Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window) | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |\\n\\n**_Huge and Gargantuan Objects_**. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an _earthquake_ spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\\n\\n**_Objects and Damage Types_**. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\\n\\n**_Damage Threshold_**. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd',", "doc_id": "73c14848-51bf-4431-b806-b72874e48e50", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7b447284eb789f6bd95392664a4d53071766088ba25c9ea7f5546acd40f86dc1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 217317, "end": 220573}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "9feb45a6-cefe-4f54-9b70-dcfaae485325", "3": "1a0cfbdd-7b6f-4de9-91c6-ec597065763b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a0cfbdd-7b6f-4de9-91c6-ec597065763b": {"__data__": {"text": "or substance than others.

It's a brutal clime, and one that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.\\n\\nThe Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).\\n\\n## Norse Deities\\n\\n| Deity                                     | Alignment | Suggested Domains | Symbol                            |\\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|\\n| Odin, god of knowledge and war            | NG        |", "doc_id": "8a239c37-3047-4c35-9a94-07c63ab9f73d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "86cf6e176d201d24e65d9cdedd756366cace03d781a2667f41f849f2a2bd2ced", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 232190, "end": 234614}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "55c9b1a5-84ff-4331-9507-21f76cd40aa9", "3": "8bfc4cc5-f709-41a1-8402-9730383fcdc3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bfc4cc5-f709-41a1-8402-9730383fcdc3": {"__data__": {"text": "(deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity).

The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.\\n\\nThe worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.\\n\\n## Beyond the Material\\n\\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\\n\\n## Planar Travel\\n\\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\\n\\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\\n\\n**_Spells._** A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. _Plane shift_ and _gate_ can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. _Etherealness_ allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the Elemental Planes. And the _astral projection_ spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\\n\\n**_Portals._** A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations- circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).\\n\\n## Transitive Planes\\n\\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as _etherealness_ and _astral projection_ allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\\n\\nThe **Ethereal Plane** is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great", "doc_id": "8894e561-e751-429b-979b-64f2f9e1eea2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6f94f939569b2bcb741711101852581b8e3bcb278f150413d74a931d86e5d774", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 238332, "end": 242390}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "31bf633b-9cfb-4e94-b1a9-8c01b3d7a2f8", "3": "a3497910-ff2f-4d6b-89c2-b1f5238c303f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3497910-ff2f-4d6b-89c2-b1f5238c303f": {"__data__": {"text": "or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.

They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as _etherealness_ and _astral projection_ allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.\\n\\nThe **Ethereal Plane** is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the _see invisibility_ and _true seeing_ spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as _forcecage_ and _wall of force_. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.\\n\\nThe **Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.\\n\\n## Inner Planes\\n\\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were made. The four **Elemental Planes**-Air, Earth, Fire, and Water-form a ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning **Elemental Chaos**.\\n\\nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.\\n\\n## Outer Planes\\n\\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.\\n\\nWhen discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \u201cplaces\u201d at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\\n\\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive.

Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.\\n\\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth, in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.\\n\\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades of distinction between them.\\n\\n### Outer Planes\\n\\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the **Upper Planes**. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the **Lower Planes**. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\\n\\n### Demiplanes\\n\\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as _demiplane_, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a _plane shift_ spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The _gate_ spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd', 'parent': 'Appendix'}, {'slug': 'poisons', 'name': 'Poisons', 'desc': \"Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.\\n\\nPoisons come in the following four types.\\n\\n**_Contact_**.

Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.\\n\\n## What Is a Spell?\\n\\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect-in most cases, all in the span of seconds.\\n\\nSpells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.\\n\\nUncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.\\n\\n## Spell Level\\n\\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) _magic missile_ at 1st level and the earth-shaking _wish_ at 9th. Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\\n\\nSpell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\\n\\n## Known and Prepared Spells\\n\\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic", "doc_id": "56d5b96f-91f3-4a3d-aceb-b640f0d47b96", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b4f1a8134ed381ef7cc01ce1cf7dadd98f90508d349a77fad6a929ce2382fffb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 263867, "end": 267702}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "1890cb5d-e7af-4f3f-b00a-bd4067853a01", "3": "c4110bc2-5d3f-4f86-b37e-7b28473e3f80"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4110bc2-5d3f-4f86-b37e-7b28473e3f80": {"__data__": {"text": "Spell Level\\n\\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9.

Cantrips-simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote-are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\\n\\nSpell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.\\n\\n## Known and Prepared Spells\\n\\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\\n\\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level.\\n\\n## Spell Slots\\n\\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\\n\\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \u201cfilling\u201d a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size-small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts _magic missile_, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\\n\\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.\\n\\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\\n\\n### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level\\n\\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts _magic missile_ using one of her 2nd-level slots, that _magic missile_ is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\\n\\nSome spells, such as _magic missile_ and _cure wounds_, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.\\n\\n> ## Casting in Armor\\n>\\n>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.\\n\\n## Cantrips\\n\\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.\\n\\n## Rituals\\n\\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual.

Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.\\n\\n## Rituals\\n\\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.\\n\\nTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.\\n\\n## Casting a Spell\\n\\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.\\n\\nEach spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.\\n\\n## Casting Time\\n\\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\\n\\n### Bonus Action\\n\\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\\n\\n### Reactions\\n\\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\\n\\n### Longer Casting Times\\n\\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see \u201cConcentration\u201d below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\\n\\n## Spell Range\\n\\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like _magic missile_, the target is a creature. For a spell like _fireball_, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\\n\\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the _shield_ spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\\n\\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you (see \u201cAreas of Effect\u201d later in the this chapter).\\n\\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.\\n\\n## Components\\n\\nA spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M)", "doc_id": "1cdc8b19-ef63-451a-8912-a6cafd17868f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5b04f55a03810fdacb5233b7af943bf65d7ba1e61b3ea4df5d72474b63b8f8c5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 271536, "end": 275413}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "c4110bc2-5d3f-4f86-b37e-7b28473e3f80", "3": "92b8acd6-7670-432c-92da-74e118c72f2b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "92b8acd6-7670-432c-92da-74e118c72f2b": {"__data__": {"text": "erupts.\\n\\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet.

Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.\\n\\n### Verbal (V)\\n\\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the _silence_ spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.\\n\\n### Somatic (S)\\n\\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\\n\\n### Material (M)\\n\\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in \u201cEquipment\u201d) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\\n\\nIf a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\\n\\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components-or to hold a spellcasting focus-but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\\n\\n## Duration\\n\\nA spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\\n\\n### Instantaneous\\n\\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\\n\\n### Concentration\\n\\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\\n\\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\\n\\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\\n\\n* **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.\\n* **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\\n* **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\\n\\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as", "doc_id": "92b8acd6-7670-432c-92da-74e118c72f2b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6825cf07d7ce6aa575699897ca79f978790a10dc47eeca827c7d13b5b0b2535b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 275418, "end": 279329}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "1cdc8b19-ef63-451a-8912-a6cafd17868f", "3": "3523aaa8-ff10-4368-96ff-6d458cc7b726"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3523aaa8-ff10-4368-96ff-6d458cc7b726": {"__data__": {"text": "factors can break concentration:\\n\\n* **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration.

A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\\n\\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\\n\\n### A Clear Path to the Target\\n\\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.\\n\\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\\n\\n### Targeting Yourself\\n\\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\\n\\n## Areas of Effect\\n\\nSpells such as _burning hands_ and _cone of cold_ cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\\n\\nA spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\\n\\nA spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\\n\\n### Cone\\n\\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.\\n\\nA cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\\n\\n### Cube\\n\\nYou select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.\\n\\nA cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\\n\\n### Cylinder\\n\\nA cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder.

The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect.

The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.\\n\\nA sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.\\n\\n## Spell Saving Throws\\n\\nMany spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\\n\\nThe DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\\n\\n## Spell Attack Rolls\\n\\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\\n\\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated.\\n\\n> ## The Schools of Magic\\n>\\n> Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.\\n>\\n> The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.\\n>\\n> **Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.\\n>\\n> **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.\\n>\\n> **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.\\n>\\n> **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.\\n>\\n> **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect.

Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.\\n>\\n> Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as _animate dead_ is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.\\n>\\n> **Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.\\n\\n## Combining Magical Effects\\n\\nThe effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect-such as the highest bonus-from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\\n\\nFor example, if two clerics cast _bless_ on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd', 'parent': 'Spellcasting'}, {'slug': 'time', 'name': 'Time', 'desc': \"In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires.

Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as _glyph of warding_ and _symbol_ that function as traps.\\n\\n## Traps in Play\\n\\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\\n\\n### Triggering a Trap\\n\\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the _glyph of warding_ spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\\n\\n### Detecting and Disabling a Trap\\n\\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.\\n\\nA trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves' tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\\n\\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap's description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, _dispel magic_ has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use _dispel magic_.\\n\\nIn most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\\n\\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\\n\\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod.

Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\\n\\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\\n\\n### Trap Effects\\n\\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description specifies what happens when it is triggered.\\n\\nThe attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.\\n\\nA trap intended to be a **setback** is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a **dangerous** trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A **deadly** trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\\n\\n**Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses (table)**\\n| Trap Danger | Save DC | Attack Bonus |\\n|-------------|---------|--------------|\\n| Setback     | 10-11   | +3 to +5     |\\n| Dangerous   | 12-15   | +6 to +8     |\\n| Deadly      | 16-20   | +9 to +12    |\\n**Damage Severity by Level (table)**\\n| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |\\n|-----------------|---------|-----------|--------|\\n| 1st-4th         | 1d10    | 2d10      | 4d10   |\\n| 5th-10th        | 2d10    | 4d10      | 10d10  |\\n| 11th-16th       | 4d10    | 10d10     | 18d10  |\\n| 17th-20th       | 10d10   | 18d10     | 24d10  |\\n\\n### Complex Traps\\n\\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.\\n\\nWhen a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge.

It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.\\n\\nFor example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\\n\\n## Sample Traps\\n\\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\\n\\n### Collapsing Roof\\n\\n_Mechanical trap_\\n\\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\\n\\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\\n\\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\\n\\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it's in danger of collapse.\\n\\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\\n\\n### Falling Net\\n\\n_Mechanical trap_\\n\\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\\n\\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\\n\\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10\\n\\nStrength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\\n\\n### Fire-Breathing Statue\\n\\n_Magic trap_\\n\\nThis trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.\\n\\nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as _detect magic_, reveals an aura of evocation magic", "doc_id": "fb9f5a73-e6d7-467f-a25a-d3fb1deb8895", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "81b3895e9e848252cecb458f0e9b049de23e3f70d0fc26509c700dd8e500354e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 309834, "end": 313544}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "fd28ad78-fe1f-496c-88f0-e5cf5ed57cdf", "3": "89582658-749c-4acf-b8e0-4f54c27e9e67"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "89582658-749c-4acf-b8e0-4f54c27e9e67": {"__data__": {"text": "check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.

The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.\\n\\nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as _detect magic_, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.\\n\\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n\\nWedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful _dispel magic_ (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\\n\\n### Pits\\n\\n_Mechanical trap_\\n\\nFour basic pit traps are presented here.\\n\\n**_Simple Pit_**. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit's edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.\\n\\nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit's depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\\n\\n**_Hidden Pit_**. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.\\n\\nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit's cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.\\n\\nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\\n\\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the _arcane lock_ spell or similar magic.\\n\\n**_Locking Pit_**. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\\n\\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\\n\\n**_Spiked Pit_**. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n\\n### Poison Darts\\n\\n_Mechanical trap_\\n\\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure", "doc_id": "89582658-749c-4acf-b8e0-4f54c27e9e67", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "66e1d33dcc1c34a319f44604584712371c79df25c32f5a9f344fd67f6e8adc78", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 313521, "end": 317278}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "fb9f5a73-e6d7-467f-a25a-d3fb1deb8895", "3": "a7e8b120-313e-43cc-84a1-97b60ba35ed4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7e8b120-313e-43cc-84a1-97b60ba35ed4": {"__data__": {"text": "and the character can see.

In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n\\n### Poison Darts\\n\\n_Mechanical trap_\\n\\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\\n\\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within from launching.\\n\\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8\\n\\nbonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\\n\\n### Poison Needle\\n\\n_Mechanical trap_\\n\\nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.\\n\\nWhen the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11\\n\\n(2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.\\n\\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\\n\\n### Rolling Sphere\\n\\n_Mechanical trap_\\n\\nWhen 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap's pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.\\n\\nWith a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.\\n\\nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line.

The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.\\n\\nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures' spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's space or a creature enters its space while it's rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.\\n\\nThe sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can't go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\\n\\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere's speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\\n\\n### Sphere of Annihilation\\n\\n_Magic trap_\\n\\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.\\n\\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a _sphere of annihilation_ that can't be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal _sphere of annihilation_.\\n\\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the _sympathy_ aspect of the _antipathy/sympathy_ spell. A successful _dispel magic_ (DC 18) removes this enchantment.\", 'document__slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document__title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'document__license_url': 'http://open5e.com/legal', 'document__url': 'http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd', 'parent': 'Rules'}, {'slug': 'underwater-combat', 'name': 'Underwater Combat', 'desc': \"When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment.

Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.\\n\\nThe Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.\\n\\n## Weapon Proficiency\\n\\nYour race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are **simple** and **martial**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.\\n\\nProficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\\n\\n## Weapon Properties\\n\\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.\\n\\n**_Ammunition._** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\\n\\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see \u201cImprovised Weapons\u201d later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\\n\\n**_Finesse._** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\\n\\n**_Heavy._** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. \\n\\n**_Light_**. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\\n\\n**_Loading._** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\\n\\n**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition", "doc_id": "397b1a94-10b1-4380-bf67-d380a995eb36", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d4635967dbef072d7dd86a8a48e42f0c920f2ca9af644afd20c49bb55d24a875", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 324784, "end": 328818}, "relationships": {"1": "55896378-2b12-4fef-8156-72a729c38e8c", "2": "5ed743e0-bb70-476d-bab1-ffe451da2911", "3": "d3078bdd-d64f-435b-b8ea-130fffd1aaf5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3078bdd-d64f-435b-b8ea-130fffd1aaf5": {"__data__": {"text": "use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\\n\\n**_Loading._** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\\n\\n**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.\\n\\n**_Reach._** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.\\n\\n**_Special._** A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see \u201cSpecial Weapons\u201d later in this section).\\n\\n**_Thrown._** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.\\n\\n**_Two-Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\\n\\n**_Versatile._** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\\n\\n### Improvised Weapons\\n\\nSometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\\n\\nOften, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\\n\\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\\n\\n### Silvered Weapons\\n\\nSome monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.\\n\\n### Special Weapons\\n\\nWeapons with special rules are described here.\\n\\n**_Lance._** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you.

Before casting, the loose objects must be arranged in a suitable shape (taking up to a minute), and the construct's hit points are halved. An animated construct has a Constitution of 10, Intelligence and Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. Other characteristics are determined by the construct's size as follows.
