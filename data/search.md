The mundane details of the structures of humanoids can present considerable obstacles for you. You have to squeeze when moving through trapdoors, manholes, and similar structures even when a Medium humanoid wouldn&#x27;t have to squeeze. In addition, ladders, stairs, and similar structures are difficult terrain for you.\nWoodfriend.

You must consume 1 pound of raw meat each day or suffer the effects of starvation. If you go 24 hours without such a meal, you gain one level of exhaustion. While you have any levels of exhaustion from this trait, you can&#x27;t regain hit points or remove levels of exhaustion until you spend at least 1 hour consuming 10 pounds of raw meat.\nImperfect Undeath. You transitioned into undeath, but your transition was imperfect. Though you are a humanoid, you are susceptible to effects that target undead. You can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds, but you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric&#x27;s Turn Undead feature. Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they return you to life as a darakhul. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore you to life as a fully living member of your original race.\nPowerful Jaw. Your heavy jaw is powerful enough to crush bones to powder. Your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\nSunlight Sensitivity. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.\nUndead Resilience. You are infused with the dark energy of undeath, which frees you from some frailties that plague most creatures. You have resistance to necrotic damage and poison damage, you are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or poisoned. When you finish a short rest, you can reduce your exhaustion level by 1, provided you have ingested at least 1 pound of raw meat in the last 24 hours (see Hunger for Flesh).\nUndead Vitality. You don&#x27;t need to breathe, and you don&#x27;t sleep the way most creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state that resembles death, remaining semiconscious, for 6 hours a day. While dormant, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\nHeritage Subrace.

Alternatively, if your body is destroyed but your soul gem and memory gears are intact, they can be installed into a new body with a ritual that takes one day and 10,000 gp worth of materials.

When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell, you can choose to deal extra necrotic damage to the target equal to your level. If the creature&#x27;s race matches your Living Origin, you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. Once you use this trait, you can&#x27;t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nSpectral Resilience.

Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities---a creature&#x27;s assets as well as weaknesses.\nThe three main rolls of the game---the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll---rely on the six ability scores. The book&#x27;s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number\nAbility Scores and Modifiers\nEach of a creature&#x27;s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature&#x27;s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\nTo determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.\nWhen that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don&#x27;t roll more than one additional d20.\nIf two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling&#x27;s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\nProficiency Bonus\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\nYour proficiency bonus can&#x27;t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue&#x27;s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn&#x27;t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don&#x27;t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\nIn general, you don&#x27;t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\nAbility Checks\nAn ability check tests a character&#x27;s or monster&#x27;s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.\nThe more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success---the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\nContests\nSometimes one character&#x27;s or monster&#x27;s efforts are directly opposed to another&#x27;s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal---for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest.\nThat character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\nSkills\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual&#x27;s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character&#x27;s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster&#x27;s skill proficiencies appear in the monster&#x27;s stat block.)  For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character&#x27;s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability&#x27;s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\nStrength\n\nAthletics\n\nDexterity\n- Acrobatics\n- Sleight of Hand\n- Stealth\nIntelligence\n\nArcana\nHistory\nInvestigation\nNature\nReligion\n\nWisdom\n\nAnimal Handling\nInsight\nMedicine\nPerception\nSurvival\n\nCharisma\n\nDeception\nIntimidation\nPerformance\nPersuasion\n\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill---for example, Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character&#x27;s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\nVariant: Skills with Different Abilities\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you&#x27;re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\nPassive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn&#x27;t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere&#x27;s how to determine a character&#x27;s total for a passive check:  &amp;gt; 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check  If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\nThe rules on hiding in the Dexterity section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\nWorking Together\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who&#x27;s leading the effort---or the one with the highest ability modifier---can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves&#x27; tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can&#x27;t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\nGroup Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren&#x27;t.\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.\nOtherwise, the group fails.\nGroup checks don&#x27;t come up very often, and they&#x27;re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\nStrength\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\nStrength Checks\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics\nYour Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:  - You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while   scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to   knock you off.\n- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt   midjump.\n- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents,   storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature   tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with   your swimming.\nOther Strength Checks\nThe GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door - Break free of bonds - Push through a tunnel that is too small - Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it - Tip over a statue - Keep a boulder from rolling\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\nLifting and Carrying\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don&#x27;t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score).\nWhile pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature&#x27;s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\nVariant: Encumbrance\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\nDexterity\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\nDexterity Checks\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics\nYour Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you&#x27;re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship&#x27;s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand\nWhenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person&#x27;s pocket.\nStealth\nMake a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks\nThe GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent - Steer a chariot around a tight turn - Pick a lock - Disable a trap - Securely tie up a prisoner - Wriggle free of bonds - Play a stringed instrument - Craft a small or detailed object  Hiding  The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check&#x27;s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can&#x27;t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you.\nHowever, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception. When you hide, there&#x27;s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren&#x27;t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature&#x27;s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10  - the creature&#x27;s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or   penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,   subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency   bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in   Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in the-environment.\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\nArmor Class\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\nInitiative\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures&#x27; turns in combat.\nConstitution\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\nConstitution Checks\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\nThe GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Hold your breath - March or labor for hours without rest - Go without sleep - Survive without food or water - Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go  #### Hit Points\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you&#x27;re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\nIntelligence\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\nIntelligence Checks\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\nArcana\nYour Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory\nYour Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation\nWhen you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature\nYour Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion\nYour Intelligence (Religion) check  measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks\nThe GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Communicate with a creature without using words - Estimate the value of a precious item - Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard - Forge a document - Recall lore about a craft or trade - Win a game of skill\nSpellcasting Ability\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nWisdom\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\nWisdom Checks\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone&#x27;s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling\nWhen there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal&#x27;s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight\nYour Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone&#x27;s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine\nA Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception\nYour Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival\nThe GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks\nThe GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:  - Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow - Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead  #### Spellcasting Ability\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nCharisma\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\nCharisma Checks\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\nDeception\nYour Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone&#x27;s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\nIntimidation\nWhen you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\nPerformance\nYour Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\nPersuasion\nWhen you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk\nOther Charisma Checks\nThe GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\n\nFind the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip\nBlend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\n\nSpellcasting Ability\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\n', 'name': 'Abilities', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'abilities'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nActions in Combat\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\nTypes of Actions\nAttack\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the Making an Attack section for the rules that govern attacks. Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\nCast a Spell\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\nDash\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.\nDisengage\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn&#x27;t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\nDodge\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.\nHelp\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task.\nWhen you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally&#x27;s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\nHide\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in srd:unseen-attackers-and-targets.\nReady\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include &#x27;If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I&#x27;ll pull the lever that opens it,&#x27; and &#x27;If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.&#x27;\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell&#x27;s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the srd:web spell and ready srd:magic-missile, your srd:web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release srd:magic-missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\nSearch\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nUse an Object\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.\n', 'name': 'Actions in Combat', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'actions-in-combat'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nAdventuring Gear\nThis section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.\nAcid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.\nAlchemist&#x27;s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist&#x27;s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\nAntitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.\nArcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item-an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item- designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.\nBall Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn&#x27;t need to make the save.\nBlock and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.\nBook. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).\nCaltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature&#x27;s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn&#x27;t need to make the save.\nCandle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\nCase, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.\nCase, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.\nChain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.\nClimber&#x27;s Kit. A climber&#x27;s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber&#x27;s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can&#x27;t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can&#x27;t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.\nComponent Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell&#x27;s description).\nCrowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar&#x27;s leverage can be applied.\nDruidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.\nFishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.\nHealer&#x27;s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nHoly Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \n', 'name': 'Adventuring Gear', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'adventuring-gear'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nAlignment\nA typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\nThese brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\nLawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.\nNeutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.\nChaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\nLawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.\nNeutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don&#x27;t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.\nChaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.\nLawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.\nNeutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.\nChaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.\nAlignment in the Multiverse\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.\nThe evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god&#x27;s influence.)\nAlignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn&#x27;t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.\nMost creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.\n', 'name': 'Alignment', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'alignment'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nArmor\nFantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.\nArmor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor&#x27;s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can&#x27;t cast spells.\nArmor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.\nHeavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer&#x27;s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer&#x27;s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\nStealth. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nShields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.\nLight Armor\nMade from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nPadded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.\nLeather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.\nStudded Leather. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.\nMedium Armor\nMedium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nHide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.\nChain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer&#x27;s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.\nScale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.\nBreastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer&#x27;s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.\nHalf Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer&#x27;s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.\nHeavy Armor\nOf all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.\nHeavy armor doesn&#x27;t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn&#x27;t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\nRing Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it&#x27;s usually worn only by those who can&#x27;t afford better armor.\nChain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.\nSplint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.\nPlate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.\nArmor (table)\n\n\n\nArmor\nCost\nArmor Class (AC)\nStrength\nStealth\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nLight Armor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadded\n5 gp\n11 + Dex modifier\n-\nDisadvantage\n8 lb.\n\n\nLeather\n10 gp\n11 + Dex modifier\n-\n-\n10 lb.\n\n\nStudded leather\n45 gp\n12 + Dex modifier\n-\n-\n13 lb.\n\n\nMedium Armor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHide\n10 gp\n12 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n-\n-\n12 lb.\n\n\nChain shirt\n50 gp\n13 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n-\n-\n20 lb.\n\n\nScale mail\n50 gp\n14 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n-\nDisadvantage\n45 lb.\n\n\nBreastplate\n400 gp\n14 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n-\n-\n20 lb.\n\n\nHalf plate\n750 gp\n15 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n-\nDisadvantage\n40 lb.\n\n\nHeavy Armor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRing mail\n30 gp\n14\n-\nDisadvantage\n40 lb.\n\n\nChain mail\n75 gp\n16\nStr 13\nDisadvantage\n55 lb.\n\n\nSplint\n200 gp\n17\nStr 15\nDisadvantage\n60 lb.\n\n\nPlate\n1,500 gp\n18\nStr 15\nDisadvantage\n65 lb.\n\n\nShield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShield\n10 gp\n+2\n-\n-\n6 lb.\n\n\n\nGetting Into and Out of Armor\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor&#x27;s category.\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor&#x27;s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.\nDoff. This is the time it takes to take off armor.

Pick a target within your attack&#x27;s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\nDetermine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\nResolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\n\nIf there&#x27;s ever any question whether something you&#x27;re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you&#x27;re making an attack roll, you&#x27;re making an attack.\nAttack Rolls\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target&#x27;s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.\nModifiers to the Roll\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character&#x27;s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\nAbility Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\nSome spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.\nProficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.\nRolling 1 or 20\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.\n\nSage Advice\nSpell attacks can score critical hits, just like any other attack.\nSource: Sage Advice &amp;gt; Compendium\n\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target&#x27;s AC. This is called a critical hit.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target&#x27;s AC.\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\nCombatants often try to escape their foes&#x27; notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.\nWhen you attack a target that you can&#x27;t see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you&#x27;re guessing the target&#x27;s location or you&#x27;re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn&#x27;t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target&#x27;s location correctly.\nWhen a creature can&#x27;t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden---both unseen and unheard---when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\nRanged Attacks\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.\nRange\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can&#x27;t attack a target beyond this range.\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can&#x27;t attack a target beyond the long range.\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn&#x27;t incapacitated.\nMelee Attacks\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\nOpportunity Attacks\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don&#x27;t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don&#x27;t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe&#x27;s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you&#x27;re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you&#x27;re holding in the other hand. You don&#x27;t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\nGrappling\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you&#x27;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&#x27;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the srd:grappled condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\n\nContests in Combat\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\n\nShoving a Creature\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it srd:prone or push it away from you. If you&#x27;re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target&#x27;s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target srd:prone or push it 5 feet away from you.\n', 'name': 'Attacking', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'attacking'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nBackgrounds\nEvery story has a beginning. Your character&#x27;s background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character&#x27;s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don&#x27;t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.\nProficiencies\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in “Using Ability Scores”).\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.\nLanguages\nSome backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”\nEquipment\nEach background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.\nSuggested Characteristics\nA background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.\nCustomizing a Background\nYou might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can&#x27;t also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can&#x27;t find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.\n', 'name': 'Backgrounds', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'backgrounds'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nBetween Adventures\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure.\nMany adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\nLifestyle Expenses\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn&#x27;t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\nDowntime Activities\nBetween adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\nCrafting\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan&#x27;s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it.\nFor example, someone proficient with smith&#x27;s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the item.\nFor example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\nPracticing a Profession\nYou can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\nIf you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves&#x27; guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\nRecuperating\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\n\nEnd one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.\nFor the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.\n\nResearching\nThe time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone&#x27;s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\nFor each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses.\nThis cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\nTraining\nYou can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.\n', 'name': 'Between Adventures', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'between-adventures'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nCoins\nCommon coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The old piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don&#x27;t usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer&#x27;s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night&#x27;s rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.\nStandard Exchange Rates (table)\n\n\n\nCoin\nCP\nSP\nEP\nGP\nPP\n\n\n\n\nCopper (cp)\n1\n1/10\n1/50\n1/100\n1/1,000\n\n\nSilver (sp)\n10\n1\n1/5\n1/10\n1/100\n\n\nElectrum (ep)\n50\n5\n1\n1/2\n1/20\n\n\nGold (gp)\n100\n10\n2\n1\n1/10\n\n\nPlatinum (pp)\n1,000\n100\n20\n10\n1\n\n\n\n', 'name': 'Coins', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'coins'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nCombat Sequence\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\n\nCombat Step by Step &amp;gt; &amp;gt; 1. Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved &amp;gt; in the combat encounter is surprised. &amp;gt; 2. Establish positions. The GM decides where all the characters &amp;gt; and monsters are located. Given the adventurers&#x27; marching order or &amp;gt; their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM &amp;gt; figures out where the adversaries are̶ how far away and in what &amp;gt; direction. &amp;gt; 3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter &amp;gt; rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants&#x27; turns. &amp;gt; 4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in &amp;gt; initiative order. &amp;gt; 5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has &amp;gt; had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting &amp;gt; stops.\n\nSurprise\nA band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn&#x27;t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.\nIf you&#x27;re surprised, you can&#x27;t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can&#x27;t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren&#x27;t.\nInitiative\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.\nThe GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.\nIf a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.\nYour Turn\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed---sometimes called your walking speed---is noted on your character sheet.\nThe most common actions you can take are described in srd:actions-in-combat. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\nsrd:movement-and-position gives the rules for your move.\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can&#x27;t decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in srd:actions-in-combat.\nBonus Actions\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don&#x27;t have a bonus action to take.\n\nSage Advice\nActions and bonus actions can&#x27;t be exchanged. If you have two abilities that require bonus actions to activate you can only use one, even if you take no other actions.\nSource: Sage Advice &amp;gt; Compendium\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action&#x27;s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\nOther Activity on Your Turn\nYour turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\nReactions\nCertain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else&#x27;s. The opportunity attack  is the most common type of reaction.\nWhen you take a reaction, you can&#x27;t take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature&#x27;s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.\n', 'name': 'Combat Sequence', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'combat-sequence'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nConditions\nConditions alter a creature&#x27;s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster&#x27;s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.\nA condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.\nIf multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition&#x27;s effects don&#x27;t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn&#x27;t.\nThe following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\nBlinded\n\nA blinded creature can&#x27;t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#x27;s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\nCharmed\n\nA charmed creature can&#x27;t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\nThe charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\nDeafened\n\nA deafened creature can&#x27;t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\n\nExhaustion\n\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect&#x27;s description.\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n1\nDisadvantage on ability checks\n\n\n2\nSpeed halved\n\n\n3\nDisadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws\n\n\n4\nHit point maximum halved\n\n\n5\nSpeed reduced to 0\n\n\n6\nDeath\n\n\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect&#x27;s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect&#x27;s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature&#x27;s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature&#x27;s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\nFrightened\n\nA frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\nThe creature can&#x27;t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\nGrappled\n\nA grappled creature&#x27;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#x27;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\nThe condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).\nThe condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunder-wave spell.\n\nIncapacitated\n\nAn incapacitated creature can&#x27;t take actions or reactions.\n\nInvisible\n\nAn invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature&#x27;s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\nAttack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature&#x27;s attack rolls have advantage.\n\nParalyzed\n\nA paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can&#x27;t move or speak.\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\nAny attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\nPetrified\n\nA petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.\nThe creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can&#x27;t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\nThe creature has resistance to all damage.\nThe creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.\n\nPoisoned\n\nA poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\nProne\n\nA prone creature&#x27;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.\nThe creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.\nAn attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren&#x27;t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\nA target with total cover can&#x27;t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. \n', 'name': 'Cover', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'cover'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nDamage and Healing\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a srd:fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\nHit Points\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\nA creature&#x27;s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature&#x27;s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature&#x27;s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\nDamage Rolls\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage. When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier---the same modifier used for the attack roll---to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts srd:fireball or a cleric casts srd:flame-strike, the spell&#x27;s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\nCritical Hits\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack&#x27;s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack&#x27;s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue&#x27;s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\nDamage Types\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon&#x27;s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks---hammers, falling, constriction, and the like---deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil&#x27;s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon&#x27;s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon&#x27;s breath deal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters&#x27; bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon&#x27;s breath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer&#x27;s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric&#x27;s flame strike spell or an angel&#x27;s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters&#x27; claws deal slashing damage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the srd:thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three--- quarters.\nHealing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn&#x27;t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature&#x27;s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature&#x27;s hit points can&#x27;t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can&#x27;t regain hit points until magic such as the srd:revivify spell has restored it to life.\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall srd:unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\nInstant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\nFalling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall srd:unconscious. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\nDeath Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn&#x27;t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don&#x27;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\nStabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn&#x27;t killed by a failed death saving throw.\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an srd:unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. A stable creature doesn&#x27;t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain srd:unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn&#x27;t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\nMonsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall srd:unconscious and make death saving throws. Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall srd:unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\nKnocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls srd:unconscious and is stable.\nTemporary Hit Points\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren&#x27;t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury. When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can&#x27;t restore temporary hit points, and they can&#x27;t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn&#x27;t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you&#x27;re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they&#x27;re depleted or you finish a long rest.\n', 'name': 'Damage and Healing', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'damage-and-healing'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nDiseases\nA plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren&#x27;t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\nSample Diseases\nThe diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\nCackle Fever\nThis disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can&#x27;t be removed until the disease is cured.\nAny event that causes the infected creature great stress-including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\nSewer Plague\nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague&#x27;s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character&#x27;s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature&#x27;s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\nSight Rot\nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature&#x27;s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.\n', 'name': 'Diseases', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'diseases'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nEnvironment\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in thissection cover some of the most important ways in which adventurersinteract with the environment in such places.\nFalling\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing anadventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoningdamage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creaturelands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\nSuffocating\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + itsConstitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for anumber of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and isdying, and it can&#x27;t regain hit points or be stabilized until it canbreathe again.\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breathfor 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach airbefore it drops to 0 hit points.\nVision and Light\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring---noticing danger, findinghidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, toname just a few---rely heavily on a character&#x27;s ability to see. Darknessand other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage,creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely onsight.\nA heavily obscured area---such as darkness, opaque fog, or densefoliage---blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers fromthe blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates threecategories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy daysprovide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sourcesof illumination within a specific radius.\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. Anarea of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of brightlight, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light oftwilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliantfull moon might bathe the land in dim light.\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darknessoutdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of anunlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magicaldarkness.\nBlindsight\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relyingon sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such asoozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such asbats and true dragons, have this sense.\nDarkvision\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwellunderground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature withdarkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, soareas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature isconcerned. However, the creature can&#x27;t discern color in darkness, onlyshades of gray.\nTruesight\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normaland magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects,automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throwsagainst them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or acreature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can seeinto the Ethereal Plane.\nFood and Water\nCharacters who don&#x27;t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can&#x27;t beremoved until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\nFood\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can make food lastlonger by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in aday counts as half a day without food.\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his orher Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyondthat limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\nWater\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day ifthe weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much watermust succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to evenless water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\nInteracting with Objects\nA character&#x27;s interaction with objects in an environment is often simpleto resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or hercharacter is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, inturn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open asecret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position,though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrenchthe lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on thedifficulty of the task.\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.\nObjects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they canbe affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. TheGM determines an object&#x27;s Armor Class and hit points, and might decidethat certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds ofattacks. (It&#x27;s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objectsalways fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune toeffects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points,it breaks.\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\n', 'name': 'Environment', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'environment'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nEquipment Packs\nThe starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack. The contents of these packs are listed here.\nIf you are buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying the items individually.\nBurglar&#x27;s Pack (16 gp). Includes a backpack, a bag of 1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.\nDiplomat&#x27;s Pack (39 gp).

Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.\nLifestyle Expenses\nLifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\nAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character&#x27;s career.\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\nLifestyle Expenses (table)\n\n\n\nLifestyle\nPrice/Day\n\n\n\n\nWretched\n-\n\n\nSqualid\n1 sp\n\n\nPoor\n2 sp\n\n\nModest\n1 gp\n\n\nComfortable\n2 gp\n\n\nWealthy\n4 gp\n\n\nAristocratic\n10 gp minimum\n\n\n\nWretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\nSqualid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.\nPoor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\nModest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don&#x27;t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\nComfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\nWealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\nAristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\n\nSelf-Sufficiency\nThe expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford-paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\nMaintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn&#x27;t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nFood, Drink, and Lodging\nThe Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night&#x27;s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.\nFood, Drink, and Lodging (table)\n\n\n\nItem\nCost\n\n\n\n\nAle\n\n\n\n- Gallon\n2 sp\n\n\n- Mug\n4 cp\n\n\nBanquet (per person)\n10 gp\n\n\nBread, loaf\n2 cp\n\n\nCheese, hunk\n1 sp\n\n\nInn stay (per day)\n\n\n\n- Squalid\n7 cp\n\n\n- Poor\n1 sp\n\n\n- Modest\n5 sp\n\n\n- Comfortable\n8 sp\n\n\n- Wealthy\n2 gp\n\n\n- Aristocratic\n4 gp\n\n\nMeals (per day)\n\n\n\n- Squalid\n3 cp\n\n\n- Poor\n6 cp\n\n\n- Modest\n3 sp\n\n\n- Comfortable\n5 sp\n\n\n- Wealthy\n8 sp\n\n\n- Aristocratic\n2 gp\n\n\nMeat, chunk\n3 sp\n\n\nWine\n\n\n\n- Common (pitcher)\n2 sp\n\n\n- Fine (bottle)\n10 gp\n\n\n\nServices\nAdventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\nSkilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.\nServices (table)\n\n\n\nService Pay\nPay\n\n\n\n\nCoach cab\n\n\n\n- Between towns\n3 cp per mile\n\n\n- Within a city\n1 cp\n\n\nHireling\n\n\n\n- Skilled\n2 gp per day\n\n\n- Untrained\n2 sp per day\n\n\nMessenger\n2 cp per mile\n\n\nRoad or gate toll\n1 cp\n\n\nShip&#x27;s passage\n1 sp per mile\n\n\n\nSpellcasting Services\nPeople who are able to cast spells don&#x27;t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\nHiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment-the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.\n', 'name': 'Expenses', 'route': 'sections/', 'slug': 'expenses'}, {'document_slug': 'wotc-srd', 'document_title': 'Systems Reference Document', 'text': '\nInspiration\nInspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that&#x27;s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.\nGaining Inspiration\nYour GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.\nYou either have inspiration or you don&#x27;t - you can&#x27;t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.\nUsing Inspiration\nIf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.\nAdditionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game.
